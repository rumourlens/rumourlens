 {"Origins":"As unbelievable as such stories must sound, babies have been left on the roofs of cars that were subsequently driven away. Such accidents of forgetfulness happen with surprising regularity, and it doesn't take all that diligent a search through old newspapers to dig up news reports documenting one such incident after another: In May 1992, three-month-old Matthew Murray of Worcester, MA, was left strapped in his baby seat on top of his dad's Hyundai. The vehicle got up to speeds of 50 mph on Interstate 290 before the seat slid off the roof, landing the baby (miraculously uninjured) on the busy highway. In December 1997, two-month-old Marcus Abram of the Chicago area was placed in his car seat on the roof of his mom's car while she moved things around inside to make room for two more passengers she was picking up. The child, still strapped to the car seat, fell off the roof of the car into a busy intersection with cars whizzing by in all directions. A passing trucker noticed the baby seat, stopped, and rescued the injured infant. The child fortunately suffered nothing more serious than lacerations to the face and head. In July 1980, six-week-old Brian Kornbach was left in his infant seat on top of the family car while the adults switched places in the front seat. The child was found by a roadside in Queens by a passerby who took the injured infant to the hospital. His parents did not notice they'd failed to bring their son in off the roof until they were somewhere in the Bronx. The above are just a few of the many instances of babies being left on car tops. It's not meant to be a comprehensive list, just a representative one to provide a better idea of how often this happens. Folklorist Jan Brunvand collected information on fourteen such incidents that had taken place between 1975 and 1993.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Some of the real-life babies who went flying off car roofs and into roadside ditches were injured by the experience. In lore, that never happens either the tot is rescued from the roof of the speeding car by a vigilant policeman, or is afterwards found by the side of the road, shaken yet unharmed. For once, lore is less brutal than reality.

They were on their way to California, and they went to change drivers and the wife took the baby out of the car and put him on the roof of the car. Then they both switched sides and got back into the car. She just assumed that the husband had put the baby back in, but he hadn't even seen it. They drove off, and the baby slid off, but he was OK because he was in a plastic infant seat. About two hours later they realized that they forgot the baby. So they drove back, and someone had stopped for the baby, and the baby was OK. Variations: The situation which prompts the child to be left on the roof varies: It's a long drive and time to change drivers. The baby is placed on the roof while groceries are loaded into the car. When the car has a flat, everything has to be shifted about to get to the tire jack.","Last Updated":"7 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/mishaps/babyroof.asp","Claim":"A baby

 {"Origins":"Surprisingly, quite a few people will answer the above question by proclaiming that the mail truck has the right of way. However, traffic laws are generally a state matter, and we haven't found any state whose vehicle code specifies that mail trucks have the right of way over all other vehicles, including emergency vehicles. Nor have we found any federal statute that supersedes state traffic laws to establish right-of-way primacy for mail trucks.","Fact Check":"","Description":"So how did this belief come to be? Over the years several respondents have made stabs at providing plausible answers to this conundrum: The answer to that old theoretical puzzler is the mail truck, by virtue of its federal government status.1 That explanation makes a little sense in that we naturally expect federal authority may supersede state or local authority (even if the Postal Service's status as a \"federal agency\" isn't quite what it used to be), but a mail truck? Cars driven by FBI agents, Border Patrol automobiles, and Army vehicles (including tanks) also have \"federal government status,\" but we're not aware of any laws giving them the right of way over all other vehicles, even in non-emergency situations. [A] postal truck should have priority because maybe it was carrying a declaration of war that just had to be delivered while the emergency vehicles waited.2 Ho ho ho. Imagine Franklin D. Roosevelt announcing to Congress, \"I'm sure I dropped that declaration of war against Japan in the mail the day before yesterday. We'll just have to hold off beginning hostilities for a day or two until we can send out another copy. Tell the Navy they'll just have to sit tight for now.\" (Declarations of war were typically hand-delivered to government officials by members of the declaring countries' diplomatic corps, not shipped out via regular mail.) He gave as an example the fact that if a fire truck, an ambulance carrying a patient and a police car in pursuit of a criminal meet a mail truck carrying mail at an intersection, the mail truck has the right of way. \"In the days when this was established,\" explained Mr. Sulzer, \"communication was vital.\"3 Communication has always been vital, but so has putting out fires, catching criminals, and saving lives. Though it may be, as Mr. Sulzer suggested, that the mistaken belief about mail trucks was in part a carryover from the railroad era: \"As you may know,\" he wrote, \"the 'fast mail' trains were an important part of the operation of the railroads in their heyday. \"The mail contracts were an important source of income for the railroad and, indeed, one of the purposes for the government establishing railroads was communication through the mail. \"Generally speaking, the fast mail trains had right of way over all other traffic. That is, the track was cleared ahead of the mail. All other traffic went off on a switch track to let it by.\" We posed this question to the Los Angeles Times ' \"Street Smart\" column back in 1994, and (once they were convinced it was a legitimate question) they responded: [T]he mail truck does not have the right of way. Like other vehicles and even pedestrians, it must pull to the side of the road to let the emergency vehicles pass. Our answer comes from Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Everyone else we queried thought the question was unique, to say the least. \"That's about the craziest thing I've ever heard,\" said an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. \"I don't even know how people have time to think about stuff like that.\" Undaunted, we pressed on. \"OK,\" a California Highway Patrol officer said in a tone that suggested he didn't take the question seriously. Finally, Madison responded. \"The mail truck is not even in the running, unless the guy is a complete idiot,\" he said.4 A similar query we posed to the United States Postal Service produced the reply that the USPS was also unaware of any laws granting mail trucks right of way status. Okay, so if the mail truck doesn't have the right of way, then who does? \"Street Smart\" also provided an answer to this question from a California DMV spokesman: [O]nce the mail truck is safely to the side of the road, the question becomes trickier. Madison speculated that dispatchers would solve the situation before it arose. If they did not, he said it would make sense for the police car to go first and then the firetruck. The ambulance would go last, he said, because if \"five seconds makes a difference, you probably aren't going to save the guy anyway.\"4 We have to wonder about that answer, though: If five seconds makes a difference, then the fire department probably isn't going to save the burning building, nor the police catch the fleeing criminal either. We do note that the belief in a mail truck's having the right of way over emergency vehicles is a very old one, as evidenced by this 1920 report of a New York mail truck driver who (unsuccessfully) asserted that he was not at fault for colliding with a fire engine because he had the right of way: Mail Driver Is Fined Filipo Gateo, 36 years old, of 230 Mulberry Street, driver of an automobile mail truck that was in collision with a hose truck of Engine Company No. 55 at Watts and Varick Streets, on August 27, was fined $$35 by Magistrate Francis X. Mancuso in Traffic Court yesterday. Gateo, who was charged with reckless driving, contended that the mail truck had the right of way, but the Magistrate held that fire apparatus had the right of way over all other vehicles.5 This issue seemed to be common fodder for newspaper \"Notes & Queries\" columns in the early 20th century, with the proffered answer inevitably being that the mail truck did not have the right of way, as demonstrated by this 1912 example: Q: Would you kindly publish in your paper which has the right of way among the following: Fire engine, ambulance, United States mail wagon, and oblige a steady reader? A: In the police regulations all three are given the right of way in street traffic. According to the Bureau of Information at Police Headquarters, there is no order of precedence specified, but practically the fire engine always takes the right of way over ambulance and mail wagon, and the ambulance over the last named. The mail wagon's urgency is not supposed to be a matter of seconds.6 In fact, as the following 1893 newspaper item shows, this same question was being debated (and the same answers provided) well over a century ago years before the automobile came into common usage: Q: In case a fire engine, a United States mail wagon, and a hospital ambulance should come together, what one would have the right of way, and what one would come second? A: The impression of the local postal authorities is that the order would be: ambulance, fire engine, mail wagon. The ambulance is on a mission of life and death, the fire engine is concerned with saving property, and the mail wagon is occupied with only routine work. The first two are intended for extraordinary calls, and are drilled to a pace which mail wagons are not obliged to take.7 Finally, as the following 1887 example suggests, the issue may originally have arisen because states typically had laws mandating the right of way for emergency vehicles and laws prohibiting interference with mail delivery vehicles, but no regulations to cover the possibility that the two might come into conflict: In regard to \"Beverly's\" pertinent inquiry as to which has the right of way, \"the United States mail or a steam fire engine,\" I would say that although the law may not decide the matter ... in point of fact neither vehicle need to be detained by the other, where the drivers use ordinary judgment, and when teamsters are governed by simple courtesy.8 Ultimately, the best response to this burning question may have been the one provided in the concluding sentence of the 1893 query and answer cited above: \"This whole matter, however, is theoretical rather than practical.\"","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"Here's a question for you. Although hypothetical, it could happen. If a firetruck, police car, postal truck and ambulance all with sirens blaring and lights flashing (except the mail truck, of course) arrived simultaneously at four corners of an intersection, who would have the right of way? Who should be allowed to cross the intersection first?","Last Updated":"1 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/fourway.asp","Claim":"A United States Postal Service mail truck

 {"Origins":"The above-reproduced image and quote attributed to Donald Trump began appearing in our inbox in mid-October 2015. The format is easily recognizable as one wherein words are attributed to the individual pictured, and in this case image claims that Donald Trump made the following statement in a 1998 interview with People magazine: If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.","Fact Check":"Did Donald Trump say in 1998 that he would one day run as a Republican because they are the \"dumbest group of voters\"?","Description":"Despite People's comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that quoted his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme. Trump appeared somewhat regularly in the magazine's pages before he came to star on The Apprentice, but the bulk of the magazine's celebrity-driven coverage of him back then centered on his marriages to, and divorces from, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Trump's political endeavors (or the absence of them) did rate some space on the magazine's pages, though. For example, a December 1987 profile titled \"Too Darn Rich\" chronicled Trump's later claims that he had been courted by both Democrats and Republicans: House Speaker Jim Wright led a delegation to Trump's office asking him to chair a major fund-raising event for the Democratic Party. Trump is a Republican but gave the invitation serious consideration before bowing to pressure from GOP friends and turning down his Democratic suitors. Beryl Anthony Jr., the Arkansas Congressman who came up with the approach to Trump, was disappointed. \"There's no question he was getting a lot of pressure from the Republicans,\" Anthony told a reporter. \"It would have given him the opportunity to see if his temperament is sufficient, if he could stand the scrutiny.\" In 1988, Trump launched into an impassioned political diatribe on Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show, but he concluded by saying he \"probably\" wouldn't [ever] run for office. In 1998 (the year the quote in question purportedly appeared in People), Trump's political involvement was somewhat differently oriented: \"My information is that Donald Trump has raised in the ballpark of $$1 million for the Bush campaign and the Republican Party,\" said Sen. Steven Geller, president of the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States. \"I have heard from too many sources, including Republican lobbyists, that although Mr. Bush is denying it, the deal [to allow Indian casinos in Florida) has been cut,\" Geller said. By October 1999, Trump had become more serious about dipping his toes in political waters. Announcing on CNN's Larry King Live that he was forming an exploratory committee with the intention of running for president, Trump said: I'm a registered Republican. I'm a pretty conservative guy. I'm somewhat liberal on social issues, especially health care, et cetera, but I'd be leaving another party, and I've been close to that party ... I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he's trying to come a little more center, but he's seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don't think anybody's hitting the chord, not the chord that I want hear, and not the chord that other people want to hear, and I've seen it. At around the same time in October 1998, Trump ran through his then-current political positions with NBC's Stone Phillips: Mr. TRUMP: I'd like to see major tax cuts. PHILLIPS: Along the line, for what the Republicans are talking about eight hundred billion or so? Would you go that far? Mr. TRUMP: Along the lines of that number, yes, approximately at that number, and could even be more. PHILLIPS: Health care? Mr. TRUMP: [I'm] liberal on health care, we have to take care of people that are sick. PHILLIPS: Universal health coverage? Mr. TRUMP: I like universal, we have to take care, there's nothing else. What's the country all about if we're not going to take care of our sick? PHILLIPS: Abortion? Mr. TRUMP: I hate the concept of abortion. I hate anything about abortion, and yet, I'm totally for choice. I think you have no alternative. PHILLIPS: Gun control? Where do you stand on that? Mr. TRUMP: If you could tell me that the bad guys, the criminals, wouldn't have guns, I'd be a hundred percent for gun control. But the fact is, if you have gun control, the only people that are going to obey the laws, are going to be the good guys. So the bad guys are going to have the guns, the good guys aren't going to have the guns, and what good does that do us? So, I'm not in favor of it. Notable about the image's apparently spurious Trump quote is its purported reference to Fox News in 1998. While the Fox News Channel was rolled out across major American news markets between 1996 and 2000 (and thus isn't entirely chronologically out of place in a circa-1998 quote), the network wasn't nearly as prominent or widely watched until the 2000 election of George W. Bush, the September 11th attacks in 2001, and the start of the Iraq War in 2002. Before that time, although Fox News was making its way into living rooms across the United States, it was not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.

 {"Origins":"On 29 August 2015, a Tumblr user re-blogged a \"note\" about Adolf Hitler and World War II (originally shared by another user), appendeding a claim about the parents of former Vermont senator (and Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders' parents being Holocaust survivors: \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932.","Fact Check":"Were Bernie Sanders' parents Holocaust survivors?","Description":"He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including 6 million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\" Bernie Sanders parents are Holocaust survivors by the way. Both posts (which between them accumulated a quarter of a million comments) linked to an 11 June 2015 Christian Science Monitor article that focused on then-current online rumor claiming that Sanders maintained dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. In that article, Sanders mentioned that his father had emigrated from Poland but did not describe his parents as Holocaust survivors: Chances are, Sanders's religion would not have come up at the Monitor breakfast, except for a controversy the day before. During an interview broadcast by NPR, host Diane Rehm had asserted, mistakenly, that Sanders was a dual US-Israeli citizen. He immediately corrected her, calling it \"nonsense that goes on in the Internet.\" But Ms. Rehm pressed on and asked about other members of Congress. Sanders took offense. \"I honestly don't know but I have read that on the Internet. You know, my dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. He loved this country. I am, you know, I got offended a little bit by that comment, and I know it's been on the Internet. I am obviously an American citizen, and I do not have any dual citizenship.\" Similarly, a 21 January 2007 New York Times magazine article on Sanders reported that Sanders' father Eli came from Poland and \"saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust,\" but did not state that Eli Sanders himself was a Holocaust survivor: Sanders's parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father, Eli, a struggling paint salesman who saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust, worried constantly about supporting his wife and two sons. His mother, Dorothy, dreamed of living in a \"private home,\" but they never made it beyond their three-and-a-half-room apartment on East 26th and Kings Highway. She died at age 46, when Bernie was 19. \"Sensitivity to class was imbedded in me then quite deeply,\" Sanders told me. On 25 July 2015, the Sanders for President campaign released a five-minute long video spot titled \"Progress,\" in which (at the 30-second mark) Sanders briefly stated that his mother was born in New York (not Poland) and had died young: Tablet magazine published an in-depth piece on Sanders on 20 August 2015 that provided additional detail about Sanders' parents, reporting that Eli Sanders' immigrated to the U.S. in 1921, well before the outbreak of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust (although a number of Eli Sanders' relatives who remained in Poland perished in concentration camps years later): Bernie Sanders is a typical American Jew of his generation in that his story doesn't hew to any preconceived narratives or stereotypes, except for the fact that it begins in Brooklyn, where he and his brother Larry grew up in a modest apartment located off Kings Highway. Like many Brooklyn families, the Sanderses aspired to become middle-class Americans while living in the shadow of the Holocaust. In 1921, Larry and Bernie s father, Eli, left his family in Slopnice, a rural village in the South of Poland, and immigrated to the United States. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Slopnice's wide-open fields were used for airdrops before the businesses and goods of the town's local Jews were closed and confiscated. Most of Eli's family was sent to concentration camps where they were killed. \"Politics was not an aside [for us],\" Larry Sanders has said. \"It was life or death.\" In late May 2015, Bernie Sanders covered the same biographic ground during a speech in Burlington, Vermont: My father came to this country from Poland without a penny in his pocket and without much of an education. My mother graduated high school in New York City. My father worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we were solidly lower-middle class. My parents, brother and I lived in a small rent-controlled apartment. My mother s dream was to move out of that small apartment into a home of our own. She died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. As a kid I learned, in many, many ways, every day, what lack of money means to a family, and that is a lesson I have never forgotten and never will. So while Bernie Sanders' father, Eli Sanders, immigrated to the United States from Poland, he did so back in 1921 thus could not accurately be described as a Holocaust survivor under even the broadest definitions of the term. Sanders' mother, Dorothy Sanders, was born in New York City and thus was neither an immigrant nor a potential victim of Nazi death camps.

 {"Origins":"Allowing motorists to obtain personalized plates provides them with an opportunity to obtain something distinctively unique, something that commands far more attention than the usual humdrum string of letters and digits. Sometimes, though, one's choice of license plate can command an unexpected and undesirable form of attention.","Fact Check":"","Description":"In 1979 a Los Angeles man named Robert Barbour found this out the hard way when he sent an application to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) requesting personalized license plates for his car. The DMV form asked applicants to list three choices in case one or two of their desired selections had already been assigned. Barbour, a sailing enthusiast, wrote down \"SAILING\" and \"BOATING\" as his first two choices; when he couldn't think of a third option, he wrote \"NO PLATE,\" meaning that if neither of his two choices was available, he did not want personalized plates. Plates reading \"BOATING\" and \"SAILING\" had indeed already been assigned, so the DMV, following Barbour's instructions literally, sent him license plates reading \"NO PLATE.\" Barbour was not thrilled that the DMV had misunderstood his intent, but he opted to keep the plates because of their uniqueness. Four weeks later he received his first notice for an overdue parking fine, from faraway San Francisco, andwithin days he began receiving dozens of overdue notices from all over the state on a daily basis. Why? Because when law enforcement officers ticketed illegally parked cars that bore no license plates, they had been writing \"NO PLATE\" in the license plate field. Now that Barbour had plates bearing that phrase, the DMV computers were matching every unpaid citation issued to a car with missing plates to him. Barbour received about 2,500 notices over the next several months. He alerted the DMV to the problem, and they responded in a typically bureaucratic way by instructing him to change his license plates. But Barbour had grown too fond of his plates by then to want to change them, so he instead began mailing out a form letter in response to each citation. That method usually worked, although occasionally he had to appear before a judge and demonstrate that the car described on the citation was not his. A couple of years later, the DMV finally caught on and sent a notice to law enforcement agencies requesting that they use the word NONE rather than NO PLATE to indicate a cited vehicle was missing its plates. This change slowed the flow of overdue notices Barbour received to a trickle, about five or six a month, but it also had an unintended side effect: Officers sometimes wrote MISSING instead of NONE to indicate cars with missing license plates, and suddenly a man named Andrew Burg in Marina del Rey started receiving parking tickets from places he hadn't visited either. Burg, of course, was the owner of a car with personalized plates reading \"MISSING.\" Nonetheless, some motorists still choose personalized plates destined to land them in similar trouble. Jim Cara of Elsmere, Delaware, found that out the hard way when he selected the phrase \"NOTAG\" for the license of his Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle in 2004: Jim Cara wanted a vanity license tag that would make people laugh. But when he chose \"NOTAG\" for the plate on his Suzuki Hayabusa, a sleek blue and silver motorcycle with a speedometer that reaches 220 mph, the joke backfired. The new tag arrived Saturday under an avalanche of Wilmington parking violations. \"All the traffic tickets say, 'Notice of violation. License number: no tag,'\" Cara said. City computers, talking to state Division of Motor Vehicles computers, had finally found an address for ticketed vehicles that lacked license tags: Cara's home in Elsmere. \"I messed up the system so bad,\" Cara said. \"I wonder if they can put me in jail or something?\" He has received more than 200 violation notices. The mail carrier came twice on Saturday. Cara opened a few. They ranged from $$55 to $$125 for violations such as meter expirations. Cara, 43, who works for the American Motorcycle Association, said he's been a lifelong prankster. This time, though, \"the cleanup is going to be worse than the joke,\" he said. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Harvey collected a few more similar tales from readers in August 2004: \"A few days ago, you printed a bit about people getting notices of unpaid parking tickets on vehicles with license plates NOTAG and NO PLATE,\" wrote Richard Turner of Beverly Hills. He recalled thinking, \"It would be cute to have VOID as my license plate. It was cute for a few years, until I started getting the unpaid parking ticket notices. Apparently, 'void' tickets got keyed into computers as valid tickets, but with my plate. Although I got all the tickets dismissed, I ditched the plates.\" And Ralph August of Westchester says a friend encountered the same barrage of strangers' parking tickets after he put an UNKNOWN plate on his car. The DMV took UNKNOWN away from him. In October 2009, the Birmingham News reported on Hunstville, Alabama, resident Scottie Roberson, who in homage to his nickname (\"Racer X\") and his favorite number (seven) had obtained personalized plates bearing a string of seven X's: 'XXXXXXX.' Suddenly, within a year's time, Roberson received multiple mailed notices of parking violations, totaling more than $$19,000 in fines, from the city of Birmingham even though he had taken his car to that city on only a single occasion in the previous five years. The culprit was his license plate: About a year ago, Roberson began receiving letters stating he had outstanding parking tickets, sometimes as many as 10 in one day in 10 places, he said. Roberson said he has been to Birmingham only once in the past five years and left without a ticket. He said city officials told him the tickets were issued by mistake because of his vanity plate XXXXXXX. When Birmingham parking patrols find cars without license plates parked illegally or at expired meters, they enter seven X's in place of the plate number, city officials said. The parking citation form calls for a plate number, and the practice is to use X's when no number is available.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"13 February 2015","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp","Claim":"A man whose car bore personalized license plates reading 'NO PLATE' received notices for thousands of unpaid parking tickets.","Tags":"","Prob Model":1,"Claim_ID":"autos_law_noplate","Google Results":[{"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"articles.latimes.com","link":"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/02/local/me-only2","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"spydersden.wordpress.com","link":"https://spydersden.wordpress.com/2012/04/page/8/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.metafilter.com","link":"http://www.metafilter.com/34543/No-Plate","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"forums.somethingawful.com","link":"http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3622681","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"forum.ebaumsworld.com","link":"http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/archive/index.php/t-107091.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.freerepublic.com","link":"http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/vanityplates/index","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.freerepublic.com","link":"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1178986/posts","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"growabrain.typepad.com","link":"http://growabrain.typepad.com/growabrain/cars_license_plates/page/2/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"mlsallpf.tripod.com","link":"http://mlsallpf.tripod.com/ncf/no-ticket-for-no-lihh.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"xapo90kmk.20fr.com","link":"http://xapo90kmk.20fr.com/19702q/licen1248.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"freerepublic.com","link":"http://freerepublic.com/tag/thisaintnews/index","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"growabrain.typepad.com","link":"http://growabrain.typepad.com/growabrain/2004/07/page/2/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"italychronicles.com","link":"http://italychronicles.com/speeding-fines-in-italy/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"link.springer.com","link":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00283-010-9170-7.pdf","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"tvtropes.org","link":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityLicensePlate","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"wikitravel.org","link":"http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.vanityfair.com","link":"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/naples-mob-paolo-di-lauro-italy","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"akdart.com","link":"http://akdart.com/cops.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"exiledonline.com","link":"http://exiledonline.com/tax-the-poor-californias-evil-financing-strategy/all/1","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.encyclopedia.com","link":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sweden.aspx","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"newsinteractive.post-gazette.com","link":"http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/prohibition/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"law.justia.com","link":"http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/7/186.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com","link":"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/storm-aftermath-live-updates-5/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.thebeijinger.com","link":"http://www.thebeijinger.com/forum/2012/05/11/motorcycles-beijing-fact-versus-fiction","link_type":"results"}}]}, 
 {"Origins":"On 5 August 2015, a wastewater leak out of an old mining site near Silverton, Colorado, affected the Animas River. According to the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was investigating reports of a leak at the mine when a plug blew and flooded a nearby tributary: The Environmental Protection Agency caused the spill on Wednesday while it was investigating a leak at the Gold King Mine. The wastewater flowed into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River in southwestern Colorado, and snaked through the river toward New Mexico.","Fact Check":"Did an accidental spill render the normally pristine blue Animas River a terrifying mustard yellow?","Description":"E.P.A. officials confirmed the leak contained heavy metals, including lead and arsenic, but said it was too early to know whether there was a health risk to humans or animals. The river was closed for recreational and other uses, but officials said water sources should be safe.

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, a meme claiming that a black woman named Amelia Bassano Lanyer was the true (uncredited) author of all of William Shakespeare's plays began circulating online. Although the authorship of Shakespeare's plays remains a topic of some debate among scholars, the above-displayed meme contains several factual errors. First, Aemilia Bassano (later Emilia Lanier) was indeed a published author, not someone whose work was suppressed because of her race or gender. In fact, the Shakespearean Authorship Trust notes that Bassano became the \"first woman to publish a book of original poetry\" when her work Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was put into print in 1611:","Fact Check":"Is a black woman named Amelia Bassano the true author of all of William Shakespeare's plays?","Description":"Brought up opposite the theatre district in a family of Venetian Jews of Moroccan ancestry, at the age of 7 she was given to be educated by Countess Susan Bertie, in the family headed by Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby. At the age of 13 she became mistress to Lord Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theatre. When she got pregnant a decade later she was expelled from court and married off to a minstrel. She was one of the first women to own and operate a school and the first woman to publish a book of original poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). She died in poverty. Second, Bassano was not black. She was born to Baptista Bassano (a Venice musician at the court of Elizabeth I) and Margaret Johnson in 1569, and biographies of her note that: (Amelia Bassano) was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews. No contemporaneous accounts describe Bassano as \"black\" (or \"African\"), and although its provenance is uncertain, many historians believe that this miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Amelia Bassano: Amelia Bassano have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano's relatives were referred to as \"black\" when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions: Brought to London from Venice in 1538/9, the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as 'black' and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry, became established as the Court recorder troupe.\" Lastly, the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare's plays is a decidedly fringe notion, even within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies. While she is listed as a potential candidate by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust (a group seemingly determined to credit Shakespeare's work to anyone but Shakespeare himself), even among that group she is included as just one of 66 candidates identified so far: She has long been identified as the 'dark lady' of the Sonnets. Her candidacy was announced in March 2007 in a lecture at the Smithsonian Institution as part of the Washington Shakespeare Festival by John Hudson, artistic director of the Dark Lady Players, a New York company who perform the underlying Jewish allegories in the plays. A 5000 word major article on her appears in the Summer/Fall 2009 special issue of The Oxfordian dedicated to the top authorship candidates.

 {"Origins":"In November 2015, a conspiracy theory essay positing that Donald Trump would be assassinated before he might become President began circulating via email and online message boards. Most iterations of the essay were titled \"An Interesting Take On Trump,\" \"DONALD TRUMP: WHAT THEY ALL FEAR MOST!\" or \" \"What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency\" and attributed to conservative commentator Bill Bennett: They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.","Fact Check":"","Description":"It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one. It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before. Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations ... like Big Pharma or Big Oil. The above-quoted essay was not written by Bill Bennett. It was originally posted on the web site Reality News Media on 17 September 2015 and circulated for several weeks with no attribution attached to it. It wasn't until mid-November 2015 that Bill Bennett's named started to appear alongside the title in an apparent attempt to lend credibility to the essay. Bennett's views on Donald Trump are not in line with those expressed in the essay. While the unknown author writes that Trump would make a good President since he is self-funded and does not play by the rules, Bennett said in an interview with Sean Hannity that he was not okay with a Trump presidency: Because I look at a man and the totality of his acts and his record and the things he has and stood for. And I think, probably, he's not very principled in terms of his convictions anyway, except he, you know, is a businessman who does things his way, his own idiosyncratic way. I do understand the appeal. People are angry, mad. And he seems big enough to kind of encompass that anger ... ... Here's Trump with a record, you know, longer than your arm, wrong on all these things, getting all this support. That's what makes me a little angry and makes me think there's a lot of irrationality on it... ... Look, if Trump's the nominee, Sean, I will support him because I won't support Hillary.

 {"Origins":"We enjoy a love/hate relationship with the police; we want them to bring criminals to justice and work to keep us safe from harm, but we equally resent their interference in our lives. This dichotomy is apparent in our attitude toward speeding; a great many of us believe speed limits are all well and good, provided they're enforced on everyone else. Belief that we should never be the ones ticketed inspires some of us to search for cheap and effective ways to render our leadfooted selves invisible to police radar guns.","Fact Check":"","Description":"However, just as holding a penny under the tongue won't help the imbiber fool a breathalyzer machine, none of the \"defeat the radar gun\" tricks touted as common knowledge mask the speeder's velocity from the gendarmes. At various times, each of the following has been ballyhooed as a surefire way to beat detection by the speed gun: Hang a compact disc from your car's rear view mirror. Stash balls of tinfoil in your vehicle's hubcaps or wrap the hubcaps themselves with this material. Festoon your jalopy's antenna with strips of tinfoil. Apply mylar strips to your chariot's license plate. Spritz your license plate with hairspray. In theory, any of the above will either scramble or deflect the signal being aimed at the vehicle. In reality, none does the speed of tinfoiled, CD'd and mylared cars is just as easily read by the radar gun as that of less tricked-out rides. The belief that affixing something shiny to one's car would render the automobile invisible to police radar dates at least to the 1980s and is common to both Canada and the U.S. As to what to do with excess compact discs now that they won't be called upon to serve as radar deflectors, a reader of Computing Canada offers this suggestion: \"Living on a farm outside of London (Ont.), our vegetable garden is constantly being attacked by voracious deer and rabbits,\" writes Lesley Fitzpatrick of, well, a farm outside of London, Ont. \"Last year, my husband strung wire around the garden and dangled AOL CDs at regular intervals all the way around. It worked like a charm. The slightest motion would set them stirring, reflecting the smallest amount of light and scaring the critters away. Too bad it doesn't work on weeds.\" Barbara \"AOL: frightening woodland creatures since 1989\" Mikkelson Sightings: Various supposed \"radar masking\" tricks were attempted in an episode of Mythbusters (\"Plywood Parachute,\" original air date 13 October 2004), including hanging a disco ball from the rearview mirror, covering the car entirely with aluminum foil, and painting the car with flat black paint to scatter the radar's beams. None worked.

Since hearing this I've noticed a few truckers with a line of CDs hanging across the bottom of the windscreen. Does this work or is it just a novel CD storage system? Is it all a myth? [Collected on the Internet, 1993] I'm trying to get to the bottom of what I think is an urban legend: that if you stuff aluminum foil in your car's hubcaps, you will effectively jam any police radar gun you happen to encounter. The least implausible explanation for this I have heard is that the reflective facets of the crumpled foil will be rotating in the hubs, and since the ground speed of any point on the circumference of a circle varies as the circle rolls, the police radar will get conflicting readings.","Last Updated":"4 February 2012","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/tinfoil.asp","Claim":"Placing tinfoil in your car's hubcaps or hanging a CD from your rear-view mirror will fool police radar.","Tags":"","Prob Model":1,"Claim_ID":"autos_law_tinfoil","Google Results":[{"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"boards.straightdope.com","link":"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=81689","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"thecastledoorqueen.tripod.com","link":"http://thecastledoorqueen.tripod.com/urbanlegends/id3.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"raoc.websitetoolbox.com","link":"http://raoc.websitetoolbox.com/post/?Car-OwnersDrivers-2425971","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"raoc.websitetoolbox.com","link":"http://raoc.websitetoolbox.com/post/car-ownersdrivers-2425971?trail=125","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/tinfoil.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"mythbustersresults.com","link":"http://mythbustersresults.com/episode18","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"boards.straightdope.com","link":"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=57159","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"image.othercrap.com","link":"http://image.othercrap.com/archives/2005_12_26_index.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"bonniescalhoun.blogspot.com","link":"http://bonniescalhoun.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_archive.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"z4zz.blogspot.com","link":"http://z4zz.blogspot.com/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.rchouse.com","link":"http://www.rchouse.com/Profile/trumpy/Comments","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.fanfiction.net","link":"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1966229/TEAMJakeward101","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"documents.mx","link":"http://documents.mx/documents/world-of-darkness-midnight-roads.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"4osel.blogspot.com","link":"http://4osel.blogspot.com/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.type2.com","link":"https://www.type2.com/lists/type2/oldarchive/listmonth/2005-02","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.imagingartist.com","link":"http://www.imagingartist.com/122705.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.kammeret.no","link":"http://www.kammeret.no/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2674&start=60","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"webby.com","link":"http://webby.com/humor/blog/index.php?m=09&y=06","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"lockitt.tripod.com","link":"http://lockitt.tripod.com/oldtrash.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.rollitup.org","link":"http://www.rollitup.org/t/what-cops-look-for.182433/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"forums.whirlpool.net.au","link":"http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1997780","link_type":"results"}}]},

Heavy fines serve to keep most of the covetous to the straight, narrow, and more crowded, but not all. Some singletons choose to brazen it out and take the risk of being ticketed. Others attempt various deceptions designed to make it appear they have passengers in their vehicles. And then there are the pregnant women who will, when pulled over for HOV lane violations, claim their unborn children as additional people in their vehicles. Early in 2006, an Arizona woman tried just that. Candace Dickinson had been fined $$367 for improper use of a High Occupancy Vehicle (aka carpool) lane. She was caught driving in the HOV lane on Interstate 10 on 8 November 2005 even though alone in her vehicle. Sgt. Dave Norton of the Phoenix police made the stop. When he asked Dickinson how many people were in the car, \"she said two as she pointed to her obvious pregnancy,\" he said. Sgt. Norton said this was the second time in the last four years that a woman tried to use the defense against him, but the first one was a \"whole lot less pregnant\" than this driver. (Dickinson's son Cole was born on 23 November 2005.) Dickinson chose to fight the ticket by asserting in court that Arizona traffic laws don't define what a person is, so the child inside her womb justified her use of the lane. Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Dennis Freeman used a \"common sense\" definition of the statutes governing use of HOV lanes in which an individual occupies a \"separate and distinct\" space in a vehicle. \"The law is meant to fill empty space in a vehicle,\" Freeman said. The California Highway Patrol sees it the same way : I'm pregnant. The HOV lane requires two persons in a vehicle. Now that I'm eating for two, can I use this lane? California law requires that in order to utilize the HOV lane, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle. Until your \"passenger\" is capable of riding in his or her own seat, you cannot count them. Other lone drivers have attempted to avail themselves of the convenience of the HOV-lane commute without legal penalty, with similar degrees of success. In February 2010, 61-year-old K.A. Franscinella of Mount Sinai, New York, attempted to fool those who police the carpool lane with a female mannequin sporting a long dark wig, blazer, shirt, and scarf. The officer who pulled her over immediately knew something was odd about the so-called passenger who was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. In January 2006, a driver was stopped and ticketed on U.S. 36 in Westminster, Colorado, for driving in a carpool lane with a mannequin he created by applying make-up to a wig stand and affixing it to clothing stuffed with newspapers (then strapping the finished product into the passenger seat with a seatbelt). In November 2005, Kevin Morgan of Petaluma, California, was handed a $$351 citation in Marinwood for driving in a carpool lane with a kickboxing dummy propped up in the passenger seat. The dummy was dressed in a baseball cap and Miami Dolphins windbreaker and wore a seatbelt. In March 2002, a motorist with a full-size mannequin as a passenger drove into the car-pool lane on Interstate 405 in Renton, WA, triggering a chain of collisions involving six cars and two buses. Susan Aeschliman-Hill of Kent, WA, had outfitted her immovable companion with a wig, sweater, and makeup. The accident occurred when Aeschliman-Hill darted into the carpool lane between two buses. Among those injured were fifteen students on a class trip. In 2001, a policeman in Atlanta pulled over a carpool lane violator who'd positioned a dummy in the passenger seat. The mannequin in question was wearing a sports jacket, a pair of sunglasses, and a baseball hat. Best of all, he had been positioned so he was holding a newspaper. Ruses motorists have used to conceal their driving alone in car-pool lanes: Store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, cardboard cut-outs, and even balloons (with faces drawn on them in marking pen). Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat. Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket or placing a doll in it. Taping a styrofoam wig stand to the passenger headrest and topping it with a blonde wig. Strapping the family pooch into the passenger seat. And no, lone hearse drivers transporting clients to their final rests cannot use the diamond lane.

Charles Bolden, who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama, issued a 1000 page document explaining the event to the White House. While Charles Bolden is a real NASA official, the Newswatch33 web site is not a legitimate news outlet. Newswatch33 is a fake news site began darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015. Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" yarn was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that has been around the online block several times before. Newswatch33 has hoaxed social media users a number of times since its inception, falsely claiming that supporters raised $$4 million for the defense of Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof, that a girl was electrocuted by her iPhone's earbuds, that Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased the rights to the Confederate flag, and that the federal government had impregnated inexpensive cigars with listening devices. In October 2015, the fake news web site Huzlers published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!\"; that article essentially repackaged the original fabrication. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included a claim that semen was found in Starbucks drinks nationwide, that McDonald's was busted using \"human meat,\" that Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their meals, and that an Ebola victim rose from the dead as a zombie.

 {"Origins":"We began seeing this cautionary tale turn up in inboxes in November 2002. Although these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Nonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road). According to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads: The only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late you may have already lost control. An example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence: Dear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic. I have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly. Use of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous. Enjoy your column every week keep up the good work. Sincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y. A: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable. I agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed. For that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver. Wet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting. Likewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out. Barbara \"spin city\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08;","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 2002] I had a wreck a couple of weeks ago and totaled our Lincoln Town Car. I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me. I learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags. The only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents. Be careful out there! [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Some good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat! A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence! When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and youtake off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred. We all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control. The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning. We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries. If you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it. You might have saved a life.","Last Updated":"12 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/techno/wetroad.asp","Claim":"Using cruise control on wet roads or during heavy rain can cause

 {"Origins":"If you have lived as an adult in the same area where you grew up, chances are you can recall at least a few fondly-remembered local landmarks of your childhood that no longer exist places or things that had special significance for you (if only in their familiarity) that have since been removed, replaced, or destroyed. They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.","Fact Check":"","Description":"One such memory of mine is a rather unusual one. It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan. Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence. The landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a 60-foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: The Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California. Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \"[T]he tunnel was an eyesore,\" she said. \"If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?\" Ms. Seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her \"canvas.\" Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti. Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months. (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.) Finally, at 8:00 PM on Friday, 28 October 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the Lynne Seemayer Westmore cliff with brushes and paint cans. By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand. For the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road. But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts. She was also deemed to be a serious traffic hazard. Foreseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go. Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin. (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.) Only after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work. (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.) As the Los Angeles Times reported twenty-five years later: Westmore arrived on the scene, and was horrified. She had assumed that she would feel no sentimental attachment to the Pink Lady, but would easily forget her as with other art projects and move on to the next. But when she saw the road crew trying to erase her work, her emotionschanged. \"I usually don't have a feeling that everything I do is precious,\" Westmore said. \"But in this case, I became its mother, and it became important for me to save her. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen.\" There was little Westmore could do. She had always wondered if the painting might land her in jail, and the county's response only heightened that concern. She stayed silent. Finally, when she realized the only way to stop the lady's removal was a court injunction, she went public. She appealed to [county Road Division head I. L.] Morhar to stop the proceedings. It made no difference. Neither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady. On Thursday, 3 November 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with 14 gallons of brown paint. (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.) County workers paint over the Pink Lady, 3 November 1966 Although Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative. She sued Los Angeles County for $$1 million over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $$26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the \"public nuisance\" she created. (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.) On the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the Los Angeles Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal: \"As I was leaving that day,\" said Westmore, who couldn't bear to watch her creation be removed, \"this woman came up to me and said, 'Let me just touch you.' That's when I knew this was starting to get out of hand.\" Another woman called Westmore every other night for two months, contending that the Pink Lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home. \"She thought I had used her daughter as a model,\" Westmore said. \"It was so pathetic. She was so convinced.\" Westmore received hate mail from people offended by the nude portrait, including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at Sunset Boulevard. She turned the letter over to the FBI. She received pictures of men masturbating. An arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted. \"It was too crazy,\" she said. \"One woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed, that the Pink Lady brought out the lust in men.\" Westmore changed her telephone number, but the calls kept coming. Finally, the stress was too much, and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary. But even in the hospital she wasn't immune from attention. \"This nurse came in, wanting me to sign something,\" Westmore recalled. \"I thought it was for some kind of medical work, but she wanted an autograph.\" In the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art to \"do something that was [her] own.\" (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.) I never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself. My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime. Somehow that made her all the more intriguing.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"17 May

 {"Origins":"In October 2015, a Facebook user shared the above-reproduced image of a sign marking the former town of Belakwa, New York, which was supposed;y abandoned in 2012 after \"a 'routine' hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreparable,\" along with a comment stating: Oh, yeah. Fracking is totally harmless.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Iterations of the image (and the sign's claims that Belakwa, New York had been abandoned due to hydrofracking) date to at least 2013, when photographs of the sign were circulated on social media with additional context: ON THIS SITE STOOD the town of BELAKWA, NY. It was abandoned in 2012 after a \"routine\" hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreprable. \"Belakwa\" = \"Bella Aqua\" = \"Beautiful Water\" Great new street art project being done in upstate NY. This siting is in Bearsville, NY outside of Woodstock, NY. As the poster correctly observed, the sign was part of a larger series of works by artist Norm Magnusson. In 2007, the New York Times profiled Magnusson's eye-catching project, rendered in the style of the state's iconic historical markers: The blue and yellow sign along Main Street in Ridgefield looked a lot like a historical marker, but something wasn t quite right. Rather than commemorate a famous person who had stood there, or an event that had shaped history, the marker honored the role of dissent in the functioning of a \"healthy democracy.\" Mr. Magnusson is an artist-activist. His cast aluminum markers focus our attention on pressing contemporary social and political issues, often restating the concerns or comments of ordinary Americans in carefully composed messages that are designed to make you think. Magnusson's subject matter is exceedingly broad, ranging across a variety of topical issues, including global warming, the war in Iraq and the debate over evolution and intelligent design. His candor is pitiless and unsparing, showing no fear or favor to any particular ideology. Magnusson's work utilizes a standard format for historical markers in New York State: No town or other settlement by the name of Belakwa ever existed in New York State. A Google Maps search on the location returned a result pointing to the museum in which Magnusson's work was displayed.

 {"Origins":"James Brown, the energetic soul singer famous for such top ten hits as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" as well as his trademark dance routines (such as his famous one-legged shimmy), has been tagged with many different nicknames during his more than fifty years in the music business: the Funky President, the Godfather of Soul, Soul Brother No. 1, the Ambassador of Soul, the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, and Mr. Dynamite. It was his wife, however, who made the most creative use of one of these sobriquets, when it was offered in her defense in an attempt to beat misdemeanor traffic charges.","Fact Check":"","Description":"On 3 September 1987, Brown's wife Adrienne was stopped in Georgia and charged with driving under the influence of drugs, speeding, and criminal trespass. She pleaded innocent to the charges, but before her case came to trial in June 1988, her lawyer tried a novel defense: diplomatic immunity. Back in 1986, the city of Augusta, Georgia, had held a James Brown Appreciation Day, and on that day, U.S. Representative Douglas Barnard of Georgia delivered a laudatory speech in which he stated that \"James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.\" So, Adrienne Brown's lawyer, Allen W. Johnson, made a motion before the court offering Rep. Barnard's statement from two years earlier as proof of James Brown's ambassadorial status, maintaining that Brown was \"America's No. 1 ambassador and as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends to his wife, the accused herein.\" The ploy didn't work. Johnson withdrew the motion the next day, claiming that he had filed it only because he was pressed for time and \"was trying to pursue every possible avenue of defense,\" and that he had \"since determined that the congressman intended his comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech,\" not as a literal recognition of Brown's ambassadorial status. In any case, Johnson's motion was bound to fail: Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United States, and United States officials while they represent America in other countries. Such immunity therefore does not extend to American citizens who commit crimes in the USA, ambassadors or not.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"9 November

 {"Origins":"After 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris a number of social media rumors circulated about Syrian refugees; the above-reproduced photograph (published to Facebook on 14 September 2015) became popular among social media claims. While the photograph included little information about the two images it encompassed, the message of it was clear. At the top, purported Syrian refugees enjoyed luxury accommodations at an unnamed hotel; at the bottom, an American veteran and his dog were left to survive on the streets.","Fact Check":"","Description":"The top image was originally published by the British tabloid Express on 28 September 2014 (more than a year before its November 2015 popularity), along with an article titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers fund migrants B&B rooms in top holiday destinations.\" The paper held: The Daily Express has learned that beleaguered Home Office officials have turned to Britannia Hotels, one of the UK s largest groups, to solve the UK s growing asylum epidemic. Coach loads of African and Arab refugees have checked in to the three-star Heathlands and Roundhouse hotels in Britain s premier destination resort while their claims for asylum are processed. The asylum seekers arrived here illegally, the majority via the Port of Calais, which is now home to 2,000 would-be illegal immigrants from a rainbow nation of war-torn countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Whether or not those claims were accurate, a few things stood out. One was that the image depicted purported asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. As such, whatever their housing arrangements might have been, it bore little relevance to the plight of homeless American veterans. While an objection could be raised about the strategy of sheltering refugees in hotels overall, it isn't as if those British bed & breakfast rooms could have been used to get American servicemen off the streets of the U.S. The Express claimed asylum seekers enjoyed luxury accommodations, but the hotel the paper named maintained a very low 2.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Nightly lodging rates for the property started at a miserly $$52 a night, and travelers described it as \"cheap,\" \"run-down,\" in need of \"renovations,\" \"shabby,\" \"grubby,\" and \"the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.\" Several were moved to share pictorial representations of the luxury they enjoyed as non-refugee guests of the hotel: Moreover, the original article didn't reference the 2015 flood of refugees from Syria. It identified the asylum seekers in question as primarily from Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. On 9 October 2014, Bournemouth's Daily Echo published an article titled \"Red Cross worker: the real story of the asylum seekers' \"seaside holiday\" in Bournemouth.\" According to that piece, the original claims were distorted and deliberately misleading: Enjoying a seaside break in luxury, complete with swimming pools and champagne: these are some of the ways the plight of asylum seekers being housed in hotels on the south coast have been described in recent weeks. As a British Red Cross worker, I d like to share with you what I saw. Last week, we arranged for an elderly woman to be taken to A&E because she had not eaten for three days. She was so weak she couldn t even walk. After the group were dropped off at the hotel, it took four days before anyone, including the local authority and the Red Cross, found out ... The hospital raised the alarm when two asylum seekers presented themselves at A&E. And that s when we were called in. We provided basics such as clothes, nappies and female sanitary products, as well as facilitating access to doctors, midwives and health visitors ... At the Red Cross, we support refugees and asylum seekers every day but I ve never seen so many people treated like this before. While it's true that asylum seekers were temporarily housed in a bed & breakfast in Bournemouth in 2014, the meme created the misleading impression that such accommodation was had at the expense of American veterans' care. The image was in fact purportedly taken in Britain in 2014, originally published as part of an anti-refugee missive. A Red Cross worker later stepped forward to clarify that the individuals housed in travel lodging were weak and ill upon their arrival in Britain, not enjoying the amenities of a free vacation. Moreover, whether the images truly depicted asylum seekers or merely involved three non-British vacation-goers remained to be seen. The Express didn't elaborate as to how they determined that the asylum seekers in question were the fellows depicted in the image. In any event, the actual asylum seekers temporarily staying in Bournemouth in no way detracted from resources available to veterans in the United States.

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, the above-displayed image (of an exceptionally large, Sicilian-style pizza) and a caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $$218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $$1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme). The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain. A small graphic displayed on the chain's web site alluded to the pizza challenge, as well as a prize of \"up to $$1,000\":","Fact Check":"Does a photograph show a real (giant) pizza, part of a challenge in which intrepid diners can win $$1,000?","Description":"However, that linked image led only to a \"coming soon\" message which offered no information about the pizza challenge or its stipulations. We reached out to Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria's corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria locations in Southern California, five currently possess the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge is most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location. Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54\" by 54\", and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $$235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza. The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, so far only two contestant teams have managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $$1,000 prize.

 {"Origins":"On 7 November 2015, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a photo gallery showing the inside of the home owned by former neurosurgeon and current 2016 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. While the gallery featured several images of paintings, awards, and certificates on the walls of Dr. Carson's house, one particular portrait of Dr. Carson posing with Jesus caught the eye of social media users: Ben Carson's house is filled with his awards and pictures, like this one of him with Jesus https://t.co/8GItclguFg pic.twitter.com/k2slHIYRfw","Fact Check":"","Description":"Peter Feld (@peterfeld) November 7, 2015 Some people found the choice of home decor peculiar, and since many viewers came across the portrait of Dr. Ben Carson and Jesus through social media posts and not via a news article, many of them wondered if the photograph was real. While we haven't been able to locate an image of the portrait other than the one offered by the Guardian, we were able to track down confirmation from another publication that a portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus did indeed hang on the neurosurgeon's walls. In 2009, Baltimore Magazine published a profile of Carson which included a description of his home, referenced the portrait in question, and noted that the imagery of the picture was consistent with Dr. Carson's expressions of faith: The family room, where Carson likes to unwind over games of pool, ping pong, and foosball, is a sort of makeshift museum of the man known for his gifted hands, and [his wife] Candy is both keeper and curator. A quick glance at the cases and walls reveals more than 50 honorary doctorate degrees from such institutions as Spelman College, Morgan State University, and Yale as well as certificates, trophies, and statues from numerous preeminent organizations. The [couple's] strong faith is also a guiding force. \"We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,\" says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. \"I don't have to be politically correct here.\" He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" Proverbs 22:4.

But Halloween does not have any definitive beginning (the holiday evolved over a long period of time and was influenced by several different cultures), and there is no basis for the notion that the first Halloween was held in 1350:","Fact Check":"Will the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 be the 666th in history?","Description":"It is widely believed that many Hallowe'en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church. Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning 'end of the summer'. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter. It is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process. A letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation. Encyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen \"in an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance\". The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe'en \"absorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain\". However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe'en, as the eve of All Saints' Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November. While Nicholas Rogers argued in his book Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night that \"festivals commemorating the saints as opposed to the original Christian martyrs appear to have been observed by 800,\" it is unclear when these festivals became what we know now as Halloween. According to various dictionaries, the word \"Halloween\" itself originated in the mid-18th century, a shortening of a term that dates to the mid-16th century: c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even \"Eve of All Saints, last night of October\" (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year's Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way. In the United States, Halloween was initially known as an occasion for playing pranks; the modern form of Halloween celebration didn't gain widespread popularity there until the early 20th century. Anoka, Minnesota, is often credited with holding the first official Halloween celebration in the United States, which took place in 1920: Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done. In 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized. It's impossible to pinpoint an exact year for the first Halloween, and the rumor about 2015's seeing the \"666th Halloween\" seems to be an offshoot of earlier joke memes claiming that in the current year Halloween will fall on Friday the 13th for the first time in 666 years.

 {"Origins":"In November 2015, debate raged on social media networks regarding the escalating plight of Syrian refugees; during that time, a circulating rumor claimed Anne Frank was denied entry to the United States before her death in the Holocaust. While most Americans were familiar with Anne Frank (and many read her diary in school), the claim labeling her a prospective refugee seemed novel. Its appearance during an ongoing debate about Syrian refugees similarly prompted some skepticism among those who hadn't before heard the it, as Frank's ordeal and death comprised a story with which many were familiar.","Fact Check":"","Description":"On 14 February 2007 The New York Times published an article titled \"Letters reveal desperate plight of Anne Frank's family,\" reporting that documents newly uncovered by an accident of circumstance revealed the Frank family's failed attempts at entry to the U.S.: After lying undisturbed in a New Jersey warehouse for nearly 30 years, documents revealing the desperate efforts of Anne Frank's family to escape to the United States and Cuba from Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941 have been discovered thanks to a clerical error. \"I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to,\" Anne's father, Otto, wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., the head of the federal Housing Authority, a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's and the son of a Macy's co-owner, asking him to put up a $$5,000 bond. \"It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance,\" Otto Frank wrote. Page by page, the papers illustrate the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States in those days. Even with powerful connections and money, European Jews could not overcome the State Department's restrictions against refugees, said two Holocaust scholars who examined the documents. As the war in Europe intensified, so too did Otto Frank's efforts to transport his family to safety. He ultimately settled on an attempt to enter through Cuba, a plan which never reached fruition: By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children's rescue agency. Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. Reuters covered the discovery on 14 February 2007, including commentary from Holocaust scholars who lamented the family's failed attempt at passage: If her father had sought help sooner, \"Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today, a writer. That is what the YIVO's documents suggest,\" said Richard Breitman, a professor at American University. However, Otto Frank decided to try to escape just as the Nazis were making it more difficult to leave and the United States was making it more difficult to enter, Breitman said. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa on December 1, 1941, according to the documents, but it was canceled 10 days later when Germany declared war on the United States. A 2007 TIME article provided further details of Otto Frank's increasingly desperate efforts: For nine months, they tried to secure visas first to the U.S. and then to Cuba until that window shut. Just three letters of the file were written by Otto Frank, all addressed to university friend Nathan Straus Jr., son of a co-owner of Macy's department store and head of the U.S. Housing Authority. Straus and Frank's brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, regularly corresponded with two private Jewish agencies, the National Refugee Service in New York and the Boston Committee for Refugees. Straus also contacted the State Department on Frank's behalf. Hollander and his brother arranged affidavits from their employers, Jacob Hiatt of E.F. Dodge Paper Box Co. and Harry Levine of the New England Novelty Co., both of Leominster, Mass. An April 2015 article titled \"Op-Ed: Getting Anne Frank All Wrong\" published to Arutz Sheva addressed the plight of Anne Frank and other Jewish refugee children who perished: Otto Frank, Anne's father, dutifully filled out the small mountain of required application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from the family's relatives in Massachusetts. But that was not enough for those who zealously guarded America's gates against refugees. In fact, in 1941, the Roosevelt administration even added a new restriction: no refugee with close relatives in Europe could come to the U.S., on the grounds that the Nazis might hold their relatives hostage in order to force the refugee to undertake espionage for Hitler. That's right: Anne Frank, Nazi spy. Anne s mother, Edith, wrote to a friend in 1939: \"I believe that all Germany's Jews are looking around the world, but can find nowhere to go.\" On 4 September 2015, Anne Frank's step-sister Eva Schloss drew direct parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II: You must not be selfish and you must share whatever you have and help in a desperate situation. They need help from you. These people have had the courage to do a very difficult thing- to take your family and your whole life to another country requires bravery and strength. This is history repeating itself. These Syrians are valuable, educated people. These are doctors and nurses who are only too willing to help our society and they will become leaders in the community if you let them. The claim that Anne Frank \"was a refugee\" confused some readers, as they hadn't heard it prior to the Syrian refugee crisis. But the extent to which Otto Frank tried (and failed) to save his family from death during World War II was only first reported in 2007, and thus didn't appear in many history lessons before that. Ultimately Frank perished (likely of Typhus) at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, shortly after the deaths of her mother and sister Margot.

 {"Origins":"In October 1996, the Internet was left giggling over the hilarious news story of a pair of not-too-bright good ol' boys and truck repairs gone wrong. Combining the key comic elements of trucks, bullets and stupidity, the tale was a sure winner.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Only one problem with the news item: It didn't happen. It was a fun story dressed up to look like a 25 July 1996 Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article, and it fooled a lot of people. It didn't fool the newspaper the fake news item had been attributed to, though. Here's a debunking of the tale by the very paper that supposedly ran the original story: A frog-gigging story that reportedly appeared in this newspaper is winding its way around the globe like a chain letter. Except the story didn't run in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. And from all indications, it's not true. That's not keeping it from circulating the Internet. In fact, the computer network is proving much speedier and far-reaching than most chain letters. Under headings such as \"True-Life Redneck Story\" and \".22 Cal Ammunition Safety Alert!!\" computer users around the United States are passing on the following story (incorrectly listed as appearing in Arkansas Democrat-Gazette July 25): Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on state Highway 38 early Monday morning. Woodruff County Deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc, and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock, are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pickup truck's headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River Bridge. After traveling approximately 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right, exiting the pavement and striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston (shot his intimate parts off) or we might have been dead,\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper for 10 years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how the accident happened,\" said Snyder. Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught, and did anyone get them from the truck. While Lavinia worries over the fate of the frogs, Arkansans worry where the story might have originated. There is no town of Cotton Patch in Woodruff County - it's Cotton Plant. No Deputy Snyder has ever worked for that county's sheriff's department. And attempts at verifying the existence of Wallis and Poole have been futile. Could it have a been an attempt to make Arkansans look stupid? \"I accuse a Yankee of it,\" says one Internet observer. No one has claimed responsibility. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ran that piece out of self-defense it kept getting calls and inquiries about the bullet fuse story, and this seemed the best way to try to put a lid on the spurious story. Where did the tale come from? It was likely a fanciful reworking of an earlier version that had appeared on the Internet in March 1996: Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was a perfect fit).

This image was likely inspired by a December 2015 Washington Post article which reported that Sanders was the only one of 16 presidential candidates (in any party) currently paying his campaign interns: In August, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted an application for unpaid interns, requiring a r sum and two letters of reference. Just a few days later, she was posting about the student debt crisis. On the Republican side, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has called the opportunity gap \"the defining issue of our time,\" and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has railed against \"upward-mobility stagnation.\" Like Clinton, both of them have proposals to reduce student debt. Even retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson wants public universities to pay the interest on student loans, while business mogul Donald Trump has accused the federal government of profiting off students. But of the 16 candidates running for president, only one pays his interns: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at $$10.10 an hour. While it may be generally accurate to say that Bernie Sanders is one of the few (if not the only) 2016 presidential candidate paying his interns, a few exceptions and clarifications that should be noted. First, the candidates offering unpaid internships are not breaking any laws. In most cases, it is perfectly legal to hire interns for non-paying positions as long as those interns receive some tangible benefit (such as school credit or valuable work experience) in return. Second, some candidates, such as Republican Ben Carson, do offer their interns others forms of compensation, such as stipends for food or travel. And neither we nor the Washington Post have been able to determine if GOP candidate Donald Trump's campaigns offers internships (or, if so, whether those internships are paid positions), although we note that interns at Trump Entertainment Resorts are reportedly paid $$10 an hour. The campaign teams of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie have all recently posted advertisements seeking interns for non-paying positions. A recent posting on Bernie Sanders' web site, on the other hand, advertises a paid internship position (although such ads do not necessarily indicate that all campaign internship positions are paying ones): Bernie 2016 is currently looking for a full-time Digital Intern. This position will require working directly with the Digital and Social Media Directors. This is a paid internship based in Washington, D.C. Unpaid internships are quite common in politics. A 2013 study by the Atlantic found that only one-third of U.S. senators paid their interns. That article also criticized Democratic senators for being more stingy in their use of unpaid interns while singling out Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) as an exception to the rule: [E]mbarrassingly, the vast majority of senators who do pay [their interns] are Republicans. Of those 35 senators [who pay their interns], only 11 are Democrats meaning almost 80 percent of Dems require volunteer participation (not counting Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats). This is peculiar and troubling for a party that elsewhere signals its commitment to fair pay, equal representation, economic inequality, and workplace welfare. When it comes to interns in the Senate, it seems that traditional beliefs about labor and economic opportunity are suddenly switched. Although President Obama is not pictured in the above-displayed image (since he is not a candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign), we also note that White House internships provide neither pay nor housing for those who fill such positions.

 {"Origins":"Traffic snarls and interminable drive-time delays are an unpleasant fact of life in Los Angeles. The burgeoning population (close to 10 million for all of Los Angeles County at last count) and the great distances traversed daily by many L.A. commuters combine to overload the area's freeway systems. One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Every large city has its \"traffic watch,\" complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but Los Angeles is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and severity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road his inattentiveness may strand him for hours. Minor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? Los Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is \"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately.\" SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on Los Angeles radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term \"SigAlert\" applied to the route they were planning to take. Causes of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles. The word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert. (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they're most frequently asked is 'What's a SigAlert?,' with the second most-asked question being \"What's the No. 1 lane?\") A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours). Since nearly everyone knew that the term 'SigAlert' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of \"signal alert.\" Other attempts to fathom what the \"Sig\" portion of \"SigAlert\" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase \"stay in garage.\" It was a minor mystery that baffled many Los Angelenos for years, as the New York Times noted in 1997: \"When I was doing traffic I got more questions about 'What the hell is a Sigalert?' than anything else,\" said Bill Keane, who pioneered radio traffic reporting on KNX and retired in 1993, after 37 years on the air and who is credited with helping popularize the term. \"But nobody knew just where it came from. It got really big in the mid-70's.\" The answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon. In 1955, Sigmon was an executive co-owner of AM radio station KMPC in Los Angeles, part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry. Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the Los Angeles Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred. Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident. So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II , put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task. His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received. By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's. Although Sigmon's notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it. Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term \"SigAlert\" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins. SigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on 22 January 1956, when a train leaving Los Angeles' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side. 29 people died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself. SigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription. Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in Los Angeles Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, \"We're not going to run the traffic for the harbor.\" In 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary added \"SigAlert\" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined \"couch potato\" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life. These days the term is no longer limited to Los Angeles or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, Los Angeles experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three. Loyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on 2 June 2004.
