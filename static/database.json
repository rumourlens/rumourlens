[{"Origins":"Most new cars now come equipped with \"Remote Keyless Entry\" (or \"Keyless Remote\" or \"Keyless Entry\" or \"Remote Entry\") systems (also known as RKE systems), a mechanism which allows automobile owners to lock and unlock their car doors remotely (from up to about 300 feet away) by pressing buttons on transmitting devices small enough to be carried on keychains. RKE systems are handy for a number of reasons: they enable drivers to unlock car doors without having to fumble around for keys (a great advantage in darkness, during inclement weather, and when one's hands are full), they enable car owners to give someone else access to their vehicles without having to hand over ignition keys, and they provide a means by which motorists can open their cars to retrieve keys that have been locked inside.","Fact Check":"","Description":"But what if you accidentally lock your remote entry device in your car along with your keys? (A plausible scenario, as many people carry them together on the same keyring.) If you own a car equipped with a system such as OnStar you can contact an operator and have OnStar unlock your vehicle remotely through a signal sent via a cellular network, but otherwise you have to call a locksmith or get a friend or relative to bring an extra set of keys out to you. Enter the idea of the poor man's OnStar. No need to pay for a fancy car-unlocking service: just use a cell phone to call someone who has access to your spare RKE device and tell him to point it at the phone and press the \"UNLOCK\" button. You simultaneously point the cell phone at your car door, and voila you're in! A nifty solution ... at least it would be if it weren't implausible for most standard remote entry systems. Relaying remote entry system signals via telephone might work if the signals were sound-based, but they're not. An RKE system transmits an encrypted data stream to a receiver inside the automobile via an RF (radio frequency) signal, a signal that can't be effectively relayed via cell phone. (In any event, RKE systems and cell phones typically operate on completely different frequencies; the former in the 300 MHz range and the latter in the 800 MHz range.) (More than a few people have inadvertently fooled themselves into believing the cell phone method of unlocking car doors actually works because they tried it and achieved the desired results not realizing their cars were still within range of their keyless remote devices, and the signals that unlocked the doors were transmitted the usual way [i.e., through the air], not via cellular phone connections.) It's possible this method might work with cars that use something different than standard RKE systems, but it doesn't work with the vast majority of models. As an owner of a vehicle equipped with an RKE system, I've found that it has reduced the likelihood of my locking my keys in the car in an unexpected way: Since I quickly became accustomed to always locking and unlocking the car with the RKE device, and I carry the RKE device on the same ring as my keys, I have to be standing outside the vehicle with my keys in my hand in order to lock it. Now if I only had something to keep me from losing my cell phone . . .

Should you lock your keys in the car and the spare keys are home, and you don't have \"OnStar,\" here's your answer to the problem!

Hold your (or anyone's) cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the other person at your home press the unlock button, holding it near the phone. Your car will unlock. and it works. Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach someone who has the other \"remote\" for your car, you can unlock the doors (or the trunk, or have the \"horn\" signal go off, or

 {"Origins":"Traffic snarls and interminable drive-time delays are an unpleasant fact of life in Los Angeles. The burgeoning population (close to 10 million for all of Los Angeles County at last count) and the great distances traversed daily by many L.A. commuters combine to overload the area's freeway systems. One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Every large city has its \"traffic watch,\" complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but Los Angeles is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and severity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road his inattentiveness may strand him for hours. Minor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? Los Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is \"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately.\" SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on Los Angeles radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term \"SigAlert\" applied to the route they were planning to take. Causes of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles. The word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert. (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they're most frequently asked is 'What's a SigAlert?,' with the second most-asked question being \"What's the No. 1 lane?\") A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours). Since nearly everyone knew that the term 'SigAlert' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of \"signal alert.\" Other attempts to fathom what the \"Sig\" portion of \"SigAlert\" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase \"stay in garage.\" It was a minor mystery that baffled many Los Angelenos for years, as the New York Times noted in 1997: \"When I was doing traffic I got more questions about 'What the hell is a Sigalert?' than anything else,\" said Bill Keane, who pioneered radio traffic reporting on KNX and retired in 1993, after 37 years on the air and who is credited with helping popularize the term. \"But nobody knew just where it came from. It got really big in the mid-70's.\" The answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon. In 1955, Sigmon was an executive co-owner of AM radio station KMPC in Los Angeles, part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry. Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the Los Angeles Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred. Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident. So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II , put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task. His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received. By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's. Although Sigmon's notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it. Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term \"SigAlert\" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins. SigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on 22 January 1956, when a train leaving Los Angeles' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side. 29 people died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself. SigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription. Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in Los Angeles Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, \"We're not going to run the traffic for the harbor.\" In 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary added \"SigAlert\" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined \"couch potato\" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life. These days the term is no longer limited to Los Angeles or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, Los Angeles experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three. Loyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on 2 June 2004.

 {"Origins":"Numerous folks swear Interstate highways in the United States must be designed so that one mile in every five is perfectly straight and flat. According to this whispered bit of facetious lore, if the U.S. ever comes under attack, those straight, flat stretches will be used as landing strips.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Belief in this crazy idea should fail anyone's logic test. It makes no sense to render inoperable the Interstate highway system during times of domestic crisis moving troops and supplies on the ground would be too important an activity to curtail just to land planes. The U.S. is riddled with any number of small, private airfields that could be pressed into service if the need arose, with that need being dependent on some foreign power having first knocked out an almost uncountable number of major airports plus those airstrips on military bases, not to mention the American fleet of aircraft carriers. Folks who commit to believing this crazy notion of highways doubling by design as airstrips are letting the romance of a \"cool fact\" blind them to what their common sense should be blinking at them in bright neon letters. Richard Weingroff, information liaison specialist for the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Infrastructure and the FHA's unofficial historian, says the closest any of this came to touching base with reality was in 1944, when Congress briefly considered the possibility of including funding for emergency landing strips in the Federal Highway-Aid Act (the law that authorized designation of a \"National System of Interstate Highways\"). At no point was the idea kited of using highways or other roads to land planes on; the proposed landing strips would have been built alongside major highways, with the highways serving to handle ground transportation access to and from these strips. The proposal was quickly dropped, and no more was ever heard of it. (A few countries do use some of their roads as military air strips, however.) Some references to the one-mile-in-five assertion claim it's part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. This piece of legislation committed the federal government to build what became the 42,800-mile Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, which makes it the logical item to cite concerning regulations about how the interstate highway system was to be laid out. The act did not, however, contain any \"one-in-five\" requirement, nor did it even suggest the use of stretches of the interstate system as emergency landing strips.

 {"Origins":"On 27 July 2015, the web site Now8News published an article titled \"Alabama Man Caught Having Sex With Pig In WalMart Bathroom,\" which claimed: Marvin Halbert of Birmingham, Alabama is in police custody after Walmart workers found him having inappropriate relations with a farm pig in the superstore restroom. Customers reported hearing loud squealing coming from the bathroom in the back area of the store near the layaway department. An eyewitness said her seven-year-old son went in to use the restroom, and came out screaming, Mommy, mommy is a man in the bathroom holding a pig really close to him!","Fact Check":"Was an Alabama man caught having sex with a pig in a Walmart bathroom?","Description":"Confused, the woman alerted a store clerk and was informed they already had several complaints about noise in the restroom. Raymond Cooper, an employee at the Walmart store, said he was the one that ran in and saved the pig. When I went into the bathroom, I heard squealing from inside the stall. I told the man to open it but he wouldn t, so I kicked it in. That crazy ass fool for real was doing a pig. I socked him in the face and grabbed the pig. That fool was out cold. However, Now8News (styled to mimic a local television station news site, like KLAS) is a newcomer to the burgeoning fake news genre, one that further aims to confuse readers by blending wildly sensational claims like the one above with re-writes of actual news events. The pig sex tale is (of course) false, and the mugshot was one of sovereign citizen and former fugitive Edward Eugene Harper. On 17 July 2015, Now8News published cannibalized a fabricated claim (involving a man on a park bench being eaten by pigeons) which first appeared on the similar fake news site NewsWatch28. On the same date, Now8News published a different, entirely made-up story claiming McDonald's was caught using aborted fetuses in Chicken McNuggets.

 {"Origins":"Stories about fiery crashes in which a car's occupants are burned alive thanks to the seat belts that held them in place have been recorded in print as far back as 1981, and one of our readers reports hearing this tale in Ohio in the 1960s.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Common to the legend about the burnt-to-death seat belt wearers is the characterization of the victims as numbering among life's innocents. They are invariably presented as sympathetic figures, a detail which works to make their gruesome deaths seem all that more appalling. One will hear that they were young marrieds with two small children, or five bridesmaids on the way to a wedding, for instance. In this legend, it seems it's not enough the carnage has to be on a large scale (four or five people trapped in a burning car is so much more horrific than having just one fellow torched); the victims have to be such that those hearing the story immediately shake their heads in disbelief at the senseless tragedy in this world. In other words, we're talking nuns, Boy Scouts, little kids, newlyweds, bridesmaids, babies, and puppy dogs. Two cremated salesmen from Des Moines won't wrench the heart the way five crisped Sisters of the Little Charity will. The false belief that it's safer not to wear a seat belt in case the vehicle catches fire persists despite the mountain of evidence countering it. Death by incineration or drowning accounts for less than one-tenth of one percent of motor-vehicle-related traumas. Most passengers who are ejected from vehicles die, and the majority of them are thrown through the windshield. The chances of injury from hitting the pavement, a fixed object, or a moving vehicle (including your own) are also much greater if you are not wearing a seat belt. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says: Most crash fatalities result from the force of impact or from being thrown from the vehicle, not from being trapped. All studies show you are much more likely to survive a crash if you are buckled in. Ejected occupants are four times as likely to be killed as those who remain inside. Yes, but what if the unthinkable happens and the car catches fire or plunges into a river? Being restrained actually increases the chances of escape from burning or submerged vehicles. Those not harnessed in get knocked around during the accident, often resulting in unconsciousness. And an unconscious accident victim has no chance of getting out of a burning or rapidly sinking car. Ann Landers in 1994 and Dear Abby in 1991 both quoted a policeman who'd seen his share of accidents: \"I've never unbuckled a dead man.\" So with the evidence so strongly stacked in favor of buckling up, why do so many persist in not wearing a seat belt and indeed in believing the fiction about the five crisped bridesmaids? The decision not to use a safety restraint is a way to deny the risks of driving. Seat belts are a clear and ever-present reminder that there is danger lurking on the roads ahead, and that any one of us could end up a traffic fatality. As muddle-headed as this must sound, by ignoring the seat belt, by assuring oneself one doesn't need it, one pretends death doesn't exist, or that at least it will never claim you. But of course the \"As long as I don't acknowledge the danger out there, I'm guaranteed to live forever\" justification isn't much to pull out of one's hat when challenged about not wearing a seat belt, hence the mental image of five cinderized bridesmaids in our legend: it's one heck of a rabbit to produce at such a moment. A legend such as this one is a confirmatory tale that affirms the rightness of a course of action the teller is already committed to. And it's a deadly course of action indeed. The Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety estimates that seat belts have saved 102,115 lives from 1986 through 1998. Virtually every study ever conducted indicates that lap and shoulder belts cut the risk of serious or fatal injury by 40 to 55%. Consider that in 1997 in North Dakota, 103 people died in a total of 88 fatal accidents on state roads. Of those 103 victims, 77 were riding in cars equipped with seat belts but were not wearing them. Thirty-four of the 88 fatal accidents were one-vehicle rollovers. Rollovers are among the most dangerous types of accidents for unrestrained drivers and passengers, since so many of them are thrown out of their vehicles. For instance, 27 people were thrown out and killed in North Dakota's 1997 accidents.

 {"Origins":"Judging from the entries made on one police blotter after another, cars around the nation are having their gas tanks sugared by those whom their owners have displeased. Why is this happening? Because, according to widespread belief, sugar poured into a gas tank will turn into a poor man's version of liquid cement and quickly render the vehicle's engine unfit for anything but a junkyard. In theory, the sugar dissolves into the gasoline, then travels along the fuel lines into the engine, where the heat of the vehicle's operations melts the sweetener into a dense sludge that gets into every nook and cranny of the engine. The sucrosed engine seizes and halts the vehicle in its tracks, but the real damage comes when the engine cools and the sludge hardens to rock-like consistency. Only the replacement of the entire engine will render the car fit for use again, says popular wisdom; otherwise, it's kiss your jalopy goodbye.","Fact Check":"","Description":"It is for such reason that this theory is so fervently cherished it appears to grant, for the price of a 5 lb. bag of sugar, the ability to effect great and irreparable harm to an adversary's most prized possession. The touted mode of vengeance is both inexpensive and easy to carry out, a combination that seems to put the power of getting even into the hands of anyone, no matter how disadvantaged. However, revenge fantasies aside, this snippet of popular lore turns out not to be the sure and deadly car killer the retribution-minded would want to believe it is. As with many grand schemes, it lives more vividly in its imagining than in reality. Sugar doesn't dissolve in gasoline, as a researcher at Berkeley confirmed in 1994. Forensics professor John Thornton labeled sucrose with radioactive carbon atoms and mixed it with gasoline, then spun the concoction in a centrifuge. After the undissolved particles were removed, the liquid's radiation level was measured to determine how much sucrose had become part of the gasoline. The answer was extremely little: the equivalent of less than a teaspoonful per 15-gallon tank of gas. Because sugar doesn't dissolve in automotive fuel, it doesn't carmelize, and so it does not turn into the debilitating gunk this well-known entry in the revenge canon calls for. Instead, sugar poured into a car's gas tank stays intact. While sugar could still cause harm if it reached the engine (but in the same way sand would, by virtue of its being a granular contaminant, not because the sugar would turn into a syrup), even that potential harm is generally prevented by filtration. At the end of the pickup tube in the gas tank is a \"sock\" that blocks solid materials, so the fuel gets through, but precious little that's not liquid does. Further up the line is the fuel filter, and what may have got through the \"sock\" does not get past it. Yet, even though the sugar will not reach the engine in either syrup or solid state, it can clog the fuel filter or the fuel injectors, a circumstance which could stop a car. A little sugar in the tank could be dealt with by no more than having to change the fuel filter a few times, but a heavier sugaring would require the gas tank be removed from the car and dumped out. Tom and Ray Magliozzi (the hosts of radio's Car Talk ) say it's not a big job for a good mechanic to drop the tank and clean it out; the process would likely cost the car's owner somewhere between $$100 and $$200. Though $$100 to $$200 is an appreciable sum, it is a far cry from the wished-for outcome of forcing the victim to have to replace the engine or scrap the car. Ironically, there may soon come a day when each of us happily puts sugar in our gas tanks. In 2002 researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison happened upon a relatively easy way to extract hydrogen from a glucose solution: heat the sugar solution to 392 F and pass it over a platinum-based catalyst to break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The resultant hydrogen could then be directed into a fuel cell that would power a car, with the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The potential for using sugar to fuel cars doesn't end with the notion of using the hydrogen extracted from glucose solutions. In 2004 researchers at Sandia National Labs began applying for patents covering ways to convert the glucose itself into energy, with an eye to using the sugar itself as a fuel source. Yet the science of the matter aside, we expect reports of sugared gas tanks to continue to appear on police blotters everywhere for as long as gasoline engines power cars. The desire for revenge runs strong so strong that it will not let such a little thing as facts get in its way. Accordingly, the best way to gain revenge on someone through the \"sugar in the gas tank\" prank might be to simply play on the belief rather than the reality just sprinkle a fair amount of sugar on the ground beneath the opening to the fuel tank of your victim's car and leave an empty sugar sack in a conspicious spot near the vehicle. Then sit back and watch your victim go wild trying to figure out how to deal with all that sugar he assumes is now in his gas tank. Barbara \"domino sugar theory\" Mikkelson Sightings: This particular revenge scheme has been imortalized in the 1996 Less Than Jake song \" Sugar in Your Gas Tank \" and has appeared in the 1996 film

 {"Origins":"Surprisingly, quite a few people will answer the above question by proclaiming that the mail truck has the right of way. However, traffic laws are generally a state matter, and we haven't found any state whose vehicle code specifies that mail trucks have the right of way over all other vehicles, including emergency vehicles. Nor have we found any federal statute that supersedes state traffic laws to establish right-of-way primacy for mail trucks.","Fact Check":"","Description":"So how did this belief come to be? Over the years several respondents have made stabs at providing plausible answers to this conundrum: The answer to that old theoretical puzzler is the mail truck, by virtue of its federal government status.1 That explanation makes a little sense in that we naturally expect federal authority may supersede state or local authority (even if the Postal Service's status as a \"federal agency\" isn't quite what it used to be), but a mail truck? Cars driven by FBI agents, Border Patrol automobiles, and Army vehicles (including tanks) also have \"federal government status,\" but we're not aware of any laws giving them the right of way over all other vehicles, even in non-emergency situations. [A] postal truck should have priority because maybe it was carrying a declaration of war that just had to be delivered while the emergency vehicles waited.2 Ho ho ho. Imagine Franklin D. Roosevelt announcing to Congress, \"I'm sure I dropped that declaration of war against Japan in the mail the day before yesterday. We'll just have to hold off beginning hostilities for a day or two until we can send out another copy. Tell the Navy they'll just have to sit tight for now.\" (Declarations of war were typically hand-delivered to government officials by members of the declaring countries' diplomatic corps, not shipped out via regular mail.) He gave as an example the fact that if a fire truck, an ambulance carrying a patient and a police car in pursuit of a criminal meet a mail truck carrying mail at an intersection, the mail truck has the right of way. \"In the days when this was established,\" explained Mr. Sulzer, \"communication was vital.\"3 Communication has always been vital, but so has putting out fires, catching criminals, and saving lives. Though it may be, as Mr. Sulzer suggested, that the mistaken belief about mail trucks was in part a carryover from the railroad era: \"As you may know,\" he wrote, \"the 'fast mail' trains were an important part of the operation of the railroads in their heyday. \"The mail contracts were an important source of income for the railroad and, indeed, one of the purposes for the government establishing railroads was communication through the mail. \"Generally speaking, the fast mail trains had right of way over all other traffic. That is, the track was cleared ahead of the mail. All other traffic went off on a switch track to let it by.\" We posed this question to the Los Angeles Times ' \"Street Smart\" column back in 1994, and (once they were convinced it was a legitimate question) they responded: [T]he mail truck does not have the right of way. Like other vehicles and even pedestrians, it must pull to the side of the road to let the emergency vehicles pass. Our answer comes from Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Everyone else we queried thought the question was unique, to say the least. \"That's about the craziest thing I've ever heard,\" said an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. \"I don't even know how people have time to think about stuff like that.\" Undaunted, we pressed on. \"OK,\" a California Highway Patrol officer said in a tone that suggested he didn't take the question seriously. Finally, Madison responded. \"The mail truck is not even in the running, unless the guy is a complete idiot,\" he said.4 A similar query we posed to the United States Postal Service produced the reply that the USPS was also unaware of any laws granting mail trucks right of way status. Okay, so if the mail truck doesn't have the right of way, then who does? \"Street Smart\" also provided an answer to this question from a California DMV spokesman: [O]nce the mail truck is safely to the side of the road, the question becomes trickier. Madison speculated that dispatchers would solve the situation before it arose. If they did not, he said it would make sense for the police car to go first and then the firetruck. The ambulance would go last, he said, because if \"five seconds makes a difference, you probably aren't going to save the guy anyway.\"4 We have to wonder about that answer, though: If five seconds makes a difference, then the fire department probably isn't going to save the burning building, nor the police catch the fleeing criminal either. We do note that the belief in a mail truck's having the right of way over emergency vehicles is a very old one, as evidenced by this 1920 report of a New York mail truck driver who (unsuccessfully) asserted that he was not at fault for colliding with a fire engine because he had the right of way: Mail Driver Is Fined Filipo Gateo, 36 years old, of 230 Mulberry Street, driver of an automobile mail truck that was in collision with a hose truck of Engine Company No. 55 at Watts and Varick Streets, on August 27, was fined $$35 by Magistrate Francis X. Mancuso in Traffic Court yesterday. Gateo, who was charged with reckless driving, contended that the mail truck had the right of way, but the Magistrate held that fire apparatus had the right of way over all other vehicles.5 This issue seemed to be common fodder for newspaper \"Notes & Queries\" columns in the early 20th century, with the proffered answer inevitably being that the mail truck did not have the right of way, as demonstrated by this 1912 example: Q: Would you kindly publish in your paper which has the right of way among the following: Fire engine, ambulance, United States mail wagon, and oblige a steady reader? A: In the police regulations all three are given the right of way in street traffic. According to the Bureau of Information at Police Headquarters, there is no order of precedence specified, but practically the fire engine always takes the right of way over ambulance and mail wagon, and the ambulance over the last named. The mail wagon's urgency is not supposed to be a matter of seconds.6 In fact, as the following 1893 newspaper item shows, this same question was being debated (and the same answers provided) well over a century ago years before the automobile came into common usage: Q: In case a fire engine, a United States mail wagon, and a hospital ambulance should come together, what one would have the right of way, and what one would come second? A: The impression of the local postal authorities is that the order would be: ambulance, fire engine, mail wagon. The ambulance is on a mission of life and death, the fire engine is concerned with saving property, and the mail wagon is occupied with only routine work. The first two are intended for extraordinary calls, and are drilled to a pace which mail wagons are not obliged to take.7 Finally, as the following 1887 example suggests, the issue may originally have arisen because states typically had laws mandating the right of way for emergency vehicles and laws prohibiting interference with mail delivery vehicles, but no regulations to cover the possibility that the two might come into conflict: In regard to \"Beverly's\" pertinent inquiry as to which has the right of way, \"the United States mail or a steam fire engine,\" I would say that although the law may not decide the matter ... in point of fact neither vehicle need to be detained by the other, where the drivers use ordinary judgment, and when teamsters are governed by simple courtesy.8 Ultimately, the best response to this burning question may have been the one provided in the concluding sentence of the 1893 query and answer cited above: \"This whole matter, however, is theoretical rather than practical.\"","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"Here's a question for you. Although hypothetical, it could happen. If a firetruck, police car, postal truck and ambulance all with sirens blaring and lights flashing (except the mail truck, of course) arrived simultaneously at four corners of an intersection, who would have the right of way? Who should be allowed to cross the intersection first?","Last Updated":"1 April 2011","Credibility":0,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/fourway.asp","Claim":"A United States Postal Service mail truck

He wants to set a point, by indicating individuals that spending more cash on something elite doesn't make you exceptional it just makes you a fool with money. He plans to lower the prices nationwide slowly over the next years to deter any backlash, specially in the black community. \"I'm just tired of people paying for the illusion that more expensive means better, when in reality my shoes cost way less to make,\" said Michael Jordan, on why he is lowering the price of Air Jordan brand sneakers. There is no truth to the above-quoted story. Not Allowed To is a fake news web site that does not publish factual stories: Notallowedto.com is intended for entertainment purposes only. Our website and social media content uses the most notorious urban and satirical entertainment news with the most shocking headlines and articles. This isn't the first time that a rumor has circulated about Michael Jordan and his Air Jordan sneakers. In December 2014, several disreputable web sites falsely claimed that Jordan said that he didn't care if people fought over his shoes as long as he still collected a check.

 {"Origins":"The above-reproduced image and quote attributed to Donald Trump began appearing in our inbox in mid-October 2015. The format is easily recognizable as one wherein words are attributed to the individual pictured, and in this case image claims that Donald Trump made the following statement in a 1998 interview with People magazine: If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.","Fact Check":"Did Donald Trump say in 1998 that he would one day run as a Republican because they are the \"dumbest group of voters\"?","Description":"Despite People's comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that quoted his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme. Trump appeared somewhat regularly in the magazine's pages before he came to star on The Apprentice, but the bulk of the magazine's celebrity-driven coverage of him back then centered on his marriages to, and divorces from, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Trump's political endeavors (or the absence of them) did rate some space on the magazine's pages, though. For example, a December 1987 profile titled \"Too Darn Rich\" chronicled Trump's later claims that he had been courted by both Democrats and Republicans: House Speaker Jim Wright led a delegation to Trump's office asking him to chair a major fund-raising event for the Democratic Party. Trump is a Republican but gave the invitation serious consideration before bowing to pressure from GOP friends and turning down his Democratic suitors. Beryl Anthony Jr., the Arkansas Congressman who came up with the approach to Trump, was disappointed. \"There's no question he was getting a lot of pressure from the Republicans,\" Anthony told a reporter. \"It would have given him the opportunity to see if his temperament is sufficient, if he could stand the scrutiny.\" In 1988, Trump launched into an impassioned political diatribe on Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show, but he concluded by saying he \"probably\" wouldn't [ever] run for office. In 1998 (the year the quote in question purportedly appeared in People), Trump's political involvement was somewhat differently oriented: \"My information is that Donald Trump has raised in the ballpark of $$1 million for the Bush campaign and the Republican Party,\" said Sen. Steven Geller, president of the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States. \"I have heard from too many sources, including Republican lobbyists, that although Mr. Bush is denying it, the deal [to allow Indian casinos in Florida) has been cut,\" Geller said. By October 1999, Trump had become more serious about dipping his toes in political waters. Announcing on CNN's Larry King Live that he was forming an exploratory committee with the intention of running for president, Trump said: I'm a registered Republican. I'm a pretty conservative guy. I'm somewhat liberal on social issues, especially health care, et cetera, but I'd be leaving another party, and I've been close to that party ... I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he's trying to come a little more center, but he's seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don't think anybody's hitting the chord, not the chord that I want hear, and not the chord that other people want to hear, and I've seen it. At around the same time in October 1998, Trump ran through his then-current political positions with NBC's Stone Phillips: Mr. TRUMP: I'd like to see major tax cuts. PHILLIPS: Along the line, for what the Republicans are talking about eight hundred billion or so? Would you go that far? Mr. TRUMP: Along the lines of that number, yes, approximately at that number, and could even be more. PHILLIPS: Health care? Mr. TRUMP: [I'm] liberal on health care, we have to take care of people that are sick. PHILLIPS: Universal health coverage? Mr. TRUMP: I like universal, we have to take care, there's nothing else. What's the country all about if we're not going to take care of our sick? PHILLIPS: Abortion? Mr. TRUMP: I hate the concept of abortion. I hate anything about abortion, and yet, I'm totally for choice. I think you have no alternative. PHILLIPS: Gun control? Where do you stand on that? Mr. TRUMP: If you could tell me that the bad guys, the criminals, wouldn't have guns, I'd be a hundred percent for gun control. But the fact is, if you have gun control, the only people that are going to obey the laws, are going to be the good guys. So the bad guys are going to have the guns, the good guys aren't going to have the guns, and what good does that do us? So, I'm not in favor of it. Notable about the image's apparently spurious Trump quote is its purported reference to Fox News in 1998. While the Fox News Channel was rolled out across major American news markets between 1996 and 2000 (and thus isn't entirely chronologically out of place in a circa-1998 quote), the network wasn't nearly as prominent or widely watched until the 2000 election of George W. Bush, the September 11th attacks in 2001, and the start of the Iraq War in 2002. Before that time, although Fox News was making its way into living rooms across the United States, it was not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.

 {"Origins":"Ever since the introduction of the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system (which automatically reads RFID transponders in tags carried within automobiles as those vehicles pass through E-ZPass toll lanes, thereby allowing motorists to avoid having to stop and pay at numerous individual toll booths), pessimists have been predicting that it's only a matter of time until municipal governments start using the passes as a means of catching speeders. By recording how long it takes cars to travel between two E-ZPass toll collection points, the theory goes, the system can automatically calculate whether a particular vehicle must have exceeded the speed limit at some point in its journey between the two checkpoints and, if so, automatically issue a citation to the automobile's registered owner (even though no law enforcement officer or device ever actually observed the vehicle in the act of speeding, and there would be no precise record of when and where the infraction occurred, or by how much the speed limit was exceeded). The e-mail reproduced above asserts that the state of New York is going to take this concept one step further, nabbing even motorists who don't use the E-ZPass system by embedding readable strips or RFID chips within vehicle registration stickers and installing recording devices at roadsides throughout the state.","Fact Check":"","Description":"We have yet to find any verified accounts of municipalities (in any state) automatically issuing traffic citations based on transit times recorded by electronic toll collection systems. Although many people maintain they have received such citations (or know someone who has), those claims have so far always proved to be misunderstandings: Motorists who travel too fast as they pass by E-Z Pass toll collection points may receive letters warning them to slow down while they use E-Z Pass lanes or else risk cancellation of their E-Z Pass accounts, but those letters are not law enforcement citations, nor are they based on speeds calculated by recording times of passage between two checkpoints. As for the claim that the state of New York is planning to embed detection strips or chips in vehicle registration stickers in order to catch speeders, we have found no evidence that such a plan is being enacted, and state officials have disclaimed it: Reports that the state Thruway Authority will start using its E-Z pass to calculate when people get on and off the toll road and issue speeding tickets are false, officials said. The rumor started circulating through e-mail and has since spread, said Sarah Kampf, public relations officer with the agency. Both the authority and state police said no such plans are in place. Any worried motorists who have heard the false reports should just stick to the speed limit and they won't have any problems, said Guy Holbert of the Thruway Authority office in Syracuse. WHAM-TV in Rochester, New York, noted that current state law would not allow for the issuance of citations based upon E-ZPass information: It is true the technology exists to encode documents, such as a driver license, with specific hidden information. However, in a statement, the New York Thruway Authority said, \"The authority and state police do not use E-ZPass to enforce vehicle and traffic law.\" To do so would require a change in the law. Currently, it takes an observation, or radar by a police officer to charge someone with speeding. This rumor may have been fostered by a distortion or misunderstanding of New York governor Eliot Spitzer's proposed plan to comply with the Real ID act by issuing new state driver's licenses in order to take advantage of recent technologies such as RFID and facial biometric scans. Similar systems (although camera-based rather than RFID-based) for tracking average motorist speeds over a distance have been tried on some particularly accident-heavy stretches of road in other parts of the world.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4681507.stm;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2215188,00.asp;http://www.ezpass.com/;","Example":"New York State started a pilot program upstate north of Albany on the Northway to catch speeders using the Easy Pass system. Recording devices were installed at intervals along the highway. Once an Easy Pass equipped vehicle passes, the device registers the account number and the time. Same is again registered at the next \"check-point\". Based upon the distance between the register points and the posted speed limit, the state is sending speeding tickets in the mail to the guilty persons. Because every driver does not have Easy Pass, the State is \"perplexed\" as what to do to impose the system state-wide. The solution has been found. Soon all new vehicle registration stickers will have a metal strip or chip imbedded in same. This will take the place of the Easy Pass system as stated above. When a vehicle passes the registering device, the strip will relay all the information. This is not fictional. New York State contracted with VERIZON to install the system. The system has already been installed and the entire Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County has been \"wired\" for when the new system begins. Once the State makes the new program public and advises all motorists of the potential for numerous speeding tickets, it will also reveal that the system has already been installed. Another reason that will be given for the new system is to enable the authorities to track stolen vehicles, to trace kidnap victims, to monitor and trace suspected criminals and terrorists, etc. BIG BROTHER IS ALIVE AND WELL. Pass this along to every one you know. Variations: A New England variant of this rumor which claimed that ticket-issuing cameras were being installed along I-84 in Connecticut began circulating in January 2010.","Last Updated":"5 April

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, a meme claiming that a black woman named Amelia Bassano Lanyer was the true (uncredited) author of all of William Shakespeare's plays began circulating online. Although the authorship of Shakespeare's plays remains a topic of some debate among scholars, the above-displayed meme contains several factual errors. First, Aemilia Bassano (later Emilia Lanier) was indeed a published author, not someone whose work was suppressed because of her race or gender. In fact, the Shakespearean Authorship Trust notes that Bassano became the \"first woman to publish a book of original poetry\" when her work Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was put into print in 1611:","Fact Check":"Is a black woman named Amelia Bassano the true author of all of William Shakespeare's plays?","Description":"Brought up opposite the theatre district in a family of Venetian Jews of Moroccan ancestry, at the age of 7 she was given to be educated by Countess Susan Bertie, in the family headed by Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby. At the age of 13 she became mistress to Lord Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theatre. When she got pregnant a decade later she was expelled from court and married off to a minstrel. She was one of the first women to own and operate a school and the first woman to publish a book of original poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). She died in poverty. Second, Bassano was not black. She was born to Baptista Bassano (a Venice musician at the court of Elizabeth I) and Margaret Johnson in 1569, and biographies of her note that: (Amelia Bassano) was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews. No contemporaneous accounts describe Bassano as \"black\" (or \"African\"), and although its provenance is uncertain, many historians believe that this miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Amelia Bassano: Amelia Bassano have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano's relatives were referred to as \"black\" when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions: Brought to London from Venice in 1538/9, the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as 'black' and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry, became established as the Court recorder troupe.\" Lastly, the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare's plays is a decidedly fringe notion, even within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies. While she is listed as a potential candidate by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust (a group seemingly determined to credit Shakespeare's work to anyone but Shakespeare himself), even among that group she is included as just one of 66 candidates identified so far: She has long been identified as the 'dark lady' of the Sonnets. Her candidacy was announced in March 2007 in a lecture at the Smithsonian Institution as part of the Washington Shakespeare Festival by John Hudson, artistic director of the Dark Lady Players, a New York company who perform the underlying Jewish allegories in the plays. A 5000 word major article on her appears in the Summer/Fall 2009 special issue of The Oxfordian dedicated to the top authorship candidates.

 {"Origins":"On 5 August 2015, a wastewater leak out of an old mining site near Silverton, Colorado, affected the Animas River. According to the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was investigating reports of a leak at the mine when a plug blew and flooded a nearby tributary: The Environmental Protection Agency caused the spill on Wednesday while it was investigating a leak at the Gold King Mine. The wastewater flowed into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River in southwestern Colorado, and snaked through the river toward New Mexico.","Fact Check":"Did an accidental spill render the normally pristine blue Animas River a terrifying mustard yellow?","Description":"E.P.A. officials confirmed the leak contained heavy metals, including lead and arsenic, but said it was too early to know whether there was a health risk to humans or animals. The river was closed for recreational and other uses, but officials said water sources should be safe.

 {"Origins":"We enjoy a love/hate relationship with the police; we want them to bring criminals to justice and work to keep us safe from harm, but we equally resent their interference in our lives. This dichotomy is apparent in our attitude toward speeding; a great many of us believe speed limits are all well and good, provided they're enforced on everyone else. Belief that we should never be the ones ticketed inspires some of us to search for cheap and effective ways to render our leadfooted selves invisible to police radar guns.","Fact Check":"","Description":"However, just as holding a penny under the tongue won't help the imbiber fool a breathalyzer machine, none of the \"defeat the radar gun\" tricks touted as common knowledge mask the speeder's velocity from the gendarmes. At various times, each of the following has been ballyhooed as a surefire way to beat detection by the speed gun: Hang a compact disc from your car's rear view mirror. Stash balls of tinfoil in your vehicle's hubcaps or wrap the hubcaps themselves with this material. Festoon your jalopy's antenna with strips of tinfoil. Apply mylar strips to your chariot's license plate. Spritz your license plate with hairspray. In theory, any of the above will either scramble or deflect the signal being aimed at the vehicle. In reality, none does the speed of tinfoiled, CD'd and mylared cars is just as easily read by the radar gun as that of less tricked-out rides. The belief that affixing something shiny to one's car would render the automobile invisible to police radar dates at least to the 1980s and is common to both Canada and the U.S. As to what to do with excess compact discs now that they won't be called upon to serve as radar deflectors, a reader of Computing Canada offers this suggestion: \"Living on a farm outside of London (Ont.), our vegetable garden is constantly being attacked by voracious deer and rabbits,\" writes Lesley Fitzpatrick of, well, a farm outside of London, Ont. \"Last year, my husband strung wire around the garden and dangled AOL CDs at regular intervals all the way around. It worked like a charm. The slightest motion would set them stirring, reflecting the smallest amount of light and scaring the critters away. Too bad it doesn't work on weeds.\" Barbara \"AOL: frightening woodland creatures since 1989\" Mikkelson Sightings: Various supposed \"radar masking\" tricks were attempted in an episode of Mythbusters (\"Plywood Parachute,\" original air date 13 October 2004), including hanging a disco ball from the rearview mirror, covering the car entirely with aluminum foil, and painting the car with flat black paint to scatter the radar's beams. None worked.

[Collected on the Internet, 1993] I'm trying to get to the bottom of what I think is an urban legend: that if you stuff aluminum foil in your car's hubcaps, you will effectively jam any police radar gun you happen to encounter. The least implausible explanation for this I have heard is that the reflective facets of the crumpled foil will be rotating in the hubs, and since the ground speed of any point on the circumference of a circle varies as the circle rolls, the police radar will get conflicting readings.","Last Updated":"4 February 2012","Credibility":-1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/tinfoil.asp","Claim":"Placing tinfoil in your car's hubcaps or hanging a CD from your rear-view mirror will fool police radar.","Tags":"","Prob Model":0.38,"Claim_ID":"autos_law_tinfoil","Google Results":[{"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/tinfoil.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"mythbustersresults.com","link":"http://mythbustersresults.com/episode18","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"boards.straightdope.com","link":"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=57159","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"boards.straightdope.com","link":"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=81689","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"thecastledoorqueen.tripod.com","link":"http://thecastledoorqueen.tripod.com/urbanlegends/id3.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"raoc.websitetoolbox.com","link":"http://raoc.websitetoolbox.com/post/?Car-OwnersDrivers-2425971","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"raoc.websitetoolbox.com","link":"http://raoc.websitetoolbox.com/post/car-ownersdrivers-2425971?trail=125","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"image.othercrap.com","link":"http://image.othercrap.com/archives/2005_12_26_index.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"bonniescalhoun.blogspot.com","link":"http://bonniescalhoun.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_archive.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"z4zz.blogspot.com","link":"http://z4zz.blogspot.com/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.rchouse.com","link":"http://www.rchouse.com/Profile/trumpy/Comments","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.fanfiction.net","link":"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1966229/TEAMJakeward101","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"documents.mx","link":"http://documents.mx/documents/world-of-darkness-midnight-roads.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"4osel.blogspot.com","link":"http://4osel.blogspot.com/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.type2.com","link":"https://www.type2.com/lists/type2/oldarchive/listmonth/2005-02","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.imagingartist.com","link":"http://www.imagingartist.com/122705.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.kammeret.no","link":"http://www.kammeret.no/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2674&start=60","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"webby.com","link":"http://webby.com/humor/blog/index.php?m=09&y=06","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"lockitt.tripod.com","link":"http://lockitt.tripod.com/oldtrash.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"www.rollitup.org","link":"http://www.rollitup.org/t/what-cops-look-for.182433/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_tinfoil","domain":"forums.whirlpool.net.au","link":"http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1997780","link_type":"results"}}]},

Can you please check out this \"800 year old cell phone found\" story that's floating around the internet? Origin:On 23 December 2015, the conspiracy theory web site Mysterious Universe published a photo purportedly showing an ancient clay tablet resembling a cellphone which was dug up by archaeologists \"earlier this year\" in Austria: While Mysterious Universe failed to provide the details you'd expect from a possibly world-changing dig, such as the names of the archaeologists, secondary photos of the tablet, comments from the team, the object's dimensions, et cetera, the web site did manage to add some wild speculation about the object: A controversial theory proposed by author Zecharia Sitchin is that aliens known as the Anunnaki came from Nibiru (the rumored Planet X beyond Neptune) and created the Sumerian civilization. The tablet looks surprisingly like a modern phone, with the 12 keys, a display and a talk button. Could these extraterrestrials have tried to introduce the Sumerians to a phone-like communications device, only to find they weren t ready for it and dialed them back to a stylus and clay tablets? While the theory that the above-displayed cellphone was created by the alien race Anunnaki from the planet Nibiru in order to introduce the Sumerian civilization to modern technology is interesting, this \"alien cellphone\" was actually created by a German sculptor and is only a few years old. Karin and Karl Weing rtner of the Art Replik Studio created the clay tablet in January 2012. While the photo was originally shared with a description similar to the one published by Mysterious Universe (Art Replik never mentioned aliens) there are several indications that this post was simply a joke, such as the title of the object, \"BablyoNokia,\" comments on the photo (\"Yes, exactly!\" in response to \"is that my old phone\"), and the fact that the image was watermarked art-replik.com. The \"alien phone\" was created in jest and was likely used as a marketing tool: The above-displayed \"ancient cellphone\" was not discovered by a group of archaeologists in Austria and it was not left behind by aliens. It was created by a German sculptor who specializes in making replicas of ancient art.

 {"Origins":"On 2 November 2015, multiple web sites reported that hacker collective Anonymous had released evidence of the involvement of several politicians in the Ku Klux Klan, as part of what was called \"OpKKK\" or \"OpHoodsOff.\" Articles dated 2 November 2015 appeared on USUncut (\"Prominent US Senators and Mayors Outed as Members of the KKK by Anonymous\") and Occupy Democrats (\"Racists Panic as Anonymous Starts Releasing Details Of KKK Members\"), with the latter claiming:","Fact Check":"","Description":"Anonymous has released a list of prominent US Senators and Mayors that have been linked to the Ku Klux Klan: Senator Tom Tillis from North Carolina Senator John Cornyn, Texas Senator, John Horne Iverson, Georgia Senator, Dan Coats, Indiana Mayor, Madeline Rogero, Knoxville TN Mayor Jim Mayer, Lexington KY Mayor Kent Guinn, Ocala, Florida Mayor Tom Henry, Fort Wayne Indiana And it is true that a large, established Twitter account linked to Anonymous promised the release of information about prominent figures linked to the KKK: We've gained access to yet another KKK Twitter account. Using the info obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 klan member identities.

 {"Origins":"The legend of the miracle high-mileage automobile has been around longer than most of our readers, with a version set it Philadelphia having appeared in a 1948 newspaper. (Even at that time, the story proved unverifiable, with the article's writer identifying it as such and passing it along only as an example of a current rumor sweeping through the community.) Since that early sighting of more than half a century ago, the legend has gone on to enthrall audience after audience as each couple of years sees it pop up anew.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Its origins are as strange as the story itself. Between 1928 and 1935, Charles Nelson Pogue, an inventor from Canada, applied for numerous patents for what he claimed was a new type of carburetor that supposedly completely vaporized gasoline before introducing it to the cylinders, thereby extracting a great deal more energy from the fuel. According to the Pogue patent description, fuel was introduced into the engine in this vaporous \"dry\" state rather than in the normal droplet-laden \"wet\" state, thus combining more readily with air, making it burn with far greater efficiency. Better combustion combined with the raising of the engine's operating temperature from 160 F to 180 F were said to be responsible for vastly improved fuel economy. So much for the techno-talk. The Pogue carburetor was touted as getting 200+ miles to the gallon. Glowing reports about this miracle of ingenuity's making a 1,879 mile trip on 14.5 gallons appeared in the May 1936 issue of Canadian Automotive Trade magazine, reports which Pogue later denied. A manager of a Winnipeg auto dealership claimed he had driven a Pogue-equipped car 217 miles on a gallon of gasoline. A different dealer principal claimed to have driven 26 miles on a pint of fuel. The story snowballed onward from those breathless testimonials as one rumor quickly followed on the heels of another. Thieves were reputed to have broken into Pogue's shop and made off with three of his carburetors. There was talk of armed guards and wolfhounds guarding the shop and the now-famous inventor. Wealthy backers (from Winnipeg or Toronto, depending on whom you heard the story from) were rumored to be bankrolling Pogue, but the arrangements mysteriously fell through. Ford of Canada was said to have bought the invention outright. All in all it was a very exciting time. Alas, one can get by on mere smoke and mirrors for only so long. Those with sense enough to not be deafened by the hyperbole were not long kept at bay with tales of wolfhounds, thieves, and mysterious briefcase-toting moneymen. They wanted to see the carburetor. That, of course, was never permitted. No one reputable was allowed to see the mechanical miracle in action, let alone have a chance to measure its results. After the initial excitement over Pogue's 1936 announcement had faded, more serious types began to openly doubt that the carburetor would work as described. In the December 1936 issue of Automotive Industries magazine, its engineering editor, P.M. Heldt, said of a sketch of the Pogue carburetor: \"The sketch fails to show any features hitherto unknown in carburetor practice, and absolutely gives no warrant for crediting the remarkable results claimed.\" Other journalists were beginning to voice similar opinions. In response to calls to put up or shut up, Pogue's miracle carburetor was heard of no more. Faced with the choice of believing someone had made claims his invention couldn't later live up to or that a monied bad guy had bought up a technology to forever keep it off the market, at least some chose to believe the suppression theory. That the carburetor never made it to the public, they said, was proof enough of its existence. Those 1930s news stories breathlessly trumpeting Pogue's miracle of technology form the basis of the economical carburetor legend now before us. As gas prices fluctuate, our dependence on fossil fuels is driven home time and again. Who wouldn't long for a miracle of engineering that would free us from the tyranny of the gas pump? And thus the groundwork for belief is laid. As sometimes happens in the world of urban legends, desire for something to be true transforms a rumor into certainty that this very thing is fact. Over the years, our legend about a 200 mpg car has bobbed to the surface in community after community, been debunked in numerous respected publications, and bobbed right back up in the wake of those debunkings. The need to believe in this wondrous technology and the evil car manufacturers who are deliberately withholding it from the market appears too strong to combat. A bit of rational thought should be all that's needed to lay this legend to rest. Why would the car manufacturers at all care about keeping such a technological advance away from consumers? Unlike the petroleum companies, they've no vested interest in how much fuel a car uses. An automaker's self interest is best served by getting the newest irresistible technology to the consumer before his competitors do. If any one of them possessed the secret of the 200 mpg car, he'd have rushed it into production, hoping to beat his competitors to the punch. Those who are tempted to believe the Evil Government is responsible for keeping this miracle out of our hands should reflect for a moment on the current state of world politics. The government of the United States would like nothing better than to throw off the yoke of dependence upon foreign oil. A miraculous carburetor would grant that freedom, allowing Americans to continue to enjoy current levels of use without the need to go hat in hand to OPEC or even those dastardly Canadians. The domestic supply would be more than enough. Though rarely is this tale told about anything other than a gas-miserly carburetor, this version describes a miraculous lightbulb: It was around 1920, shortly after he had married, when the old man originally purchased the light bulb from a small store in town. It appeared to be a normal light bulb. However, when after sixty years it was still going strong, he decided to write to the manufacturers and tell them of this remarkable phenomenon. By return a reply came from the company indicating that they were very interested in the bulb and would like to send someone to see it. Eventually, one of the directors of the firm called and, instead of just showing interest, offered to buy it for 1,000. The old man, of course, refused, as the light bulb had given him good service. However, his curiousity was certainly aroused why so much money for his light bulb? The director could provide no plausible explanation as to why they were willing to offer so much for the bulb, so the old man decided to explore this mystery further. With the help of a solicitor friend he did a little investigating and discovered that in the 1920s this particular light-bulb manufacturer had bought and tested the patent for an everlasting bulb. Only a few of these bulbs were made and the company, finding the invention worked, destroyed the bulbs and suppressed the idea after all, it would have put them out of business. Unknown to the company one of the lights had accidentally become mixed up with a batch of ordinary bulbs and this was the light bulb which had lit the old man's kitchen for the past sixty years. (Sometimes lore collides with reality: A long-lived light bulb has been burning since 1901 and currently lights a fire station in Livermore, California.) Barbara \"gasoline allied\" Mikkelson Origins: The legend about the need to suppress the steam-driven carburetor that can produce 200 mpg to protect the oil industry surfaces in an episode of the TV series Spoils of Babylon (\"The Foundling: The War Within; original air date 9 January 2014).","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563891654?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1563891654;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874835259?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0874835259;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762410744?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0762410744;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0710201400?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0710201400;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140070362?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140070362;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226158594?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0226158594;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0715613146?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0715613146;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393951693?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393951693;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393305422?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393305422;","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, 1999] A retiring General Motors employee, after many years of service, receives a car as a retirement gift. (as well as a nice pension, etc.). So he is given permission to select a car from the lot there at the factory. He selects a Chevrolet Caprice, a big, luxury car. After receiving it, he is satisfied with his choice. After all, who wouldn't enjoy driving around in a roomy, comfortable car. After driving it for a while, he noticed something quite odd ... a car like this usually consumes a substantial amount of fuel, but the gas gauge hardly moves at all. After a few weeks, he gets suspicious. Things like this don't happen. Being the company man he is, he returns it to the factory. Explaining this to the service tech must've caused some strange looks, but they took it in anyway. After he got his car back, he noticed it got the typical gas mileage of a comparable car. Could've this car had some secret \"modifications\" that allowed him to drive for weeks, on the same tank of gas? Detroit's automakers have purportedly seized, er.. bought out patents of items that improve gasoline mileage like the 100 mpg carburetor, etc. Maybe the R&D department at GM put this theory to practice, and this was an example. [Collected via e-mail, 1997] A couple journeys from Western Canada to Detroit to buy a new car and presumably save shipping costs while having a vacation in the States at the same time. Driving back to the prairies, they find to their astonishment that the gas gauge is not moving down to \"empty\" even though they've been driving for hours. Arriving home some thousands of miles away from Detroit, they have only refilled the tank once or twice. A few days after returning, the husband looks out at his driveway in the morning to find two mysterious men tinkering with his car (the hood is up). Running out, they race off; he checks under the hood, finds nothing amiss, and concludes it's just vandals or would-be thieves whom he was fortunate to apprehend before any damage was done. BUT, when they drive the car, they find their gas mileage is now normal. Variations: The miraculous car legend ends one of four ways: Mysterious men appear and tinker with the engine, rendering the car no different than any other. The car is reclaimed by the factory. If the owner afterwards gets the same car back (sometimes it's replaced outright with another vehicle), it now gets ordinary gas mileage. No-nonsense business types show up to make a fabulous offer for the car, which is accepted. The owner wakes up one morning to find the car vanished without a trace.","Last Updated":"26 June 2014","Credibility":0,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp","Claim":"A miraculous car

 {"Origins":"In an effort to encourage carpooling and thereby ease freeway congestion and lessen environmental impact, many municipalities have added High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to existing highways. HOV (aka carpool or diamond) lanes are restricted to those vehicles that have a stated minimum number of occupants or (in some parts of the U.S.) bear the appropriate stickers granting them that right (i.e. certain hybrid automobiles).","Fact Check":"","Description":"Because they are generally less populated than the rest of the highway, HOV lanes pose a temptation to unaccompanied drivers snarled in the daily commute and wistfully looking over at the more free-flowing diamond lanes. Heavy fines serve to keep most of the covetous to the straight, narrow, and more crowded, but not all. Some singletons choose to brazen it out and take the risk of being ticketed. Others attempt various deceptions designed to make it appear they have passengers in their vehicles. And then there are the pregnant women who will, when pulled over for HOV lane violations, claim their unborn children as additional people in their vehicles. Early in 2006, an Arizona woman tried just that. Candace Dickinson had been fined $$367 for improper use of a High Occupancy Vehicle (aka carpool) lane. She was caught driving in the HOV lane on Interstate 10 on 8 November 2005 even though alone in her vehicle. Sgt. Dave Norton of the Phoenix police made the stop. When he asked Dickinson how many people were in the car, \"she said two as she pointed to her obvious pregnancy,\" he said. Sgt. Norton said this was the second time in the last four years that a woman tried to use the defense against him, but the first one was a \"whole lot less pregnant\" than this driver. (Dickinson's son Cole was born on 23 November 2005.) Dickinson chose to fight the ticket by asserting in court that Arizona traffic laws don't define what a person is, so the child inside her womb justified her use of the lane. Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Dennis Freeman used a \"common sense\" definition of the statutes governing use of HOV lanes in which an individual occupies a \"separate and distinct\" space in a vehicle. \"The law is meant to fill empty space in a vehicle,\" Freeman said. The California Highway Patrol sees it the same way : I'm pregnant. The HOV lane requires two persons in a vehicle. Now that I'm eating for two, can I use this lane? California law requires that in order to utilize the HOV lane, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle. Until your \"passenger\" is capable of riding in his or her own seat, you cannot count them. Other lone drivers have attempted to avail themselves of the convenience of the HOV-lane commute without legal penalty, with similar degrees of success. In February 2010, 61-year-old K.A. Franscinella of Mount Sinai, New York, attempted to fool those who police the carpool lane with a female mannequin sporting a long dark wig, blazer, shirt, and scarf. The officer who pulled her over immediately knew something was odd about the so-called passenger who was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. In January 2006, a driver was stopped and ticketed on U.S. 36 in Westminster, Colorado, for driving in a carpool lane with a mannequin he created by applying make-up to a wig stand and affixing it to clothing stuffed with newspapers (then strapping the finished product into the passenger seat with a seatbelt). In November 2005, Kevin Morgan of Petaluma, California, was handed a $$351 citation in Marinwood for driving in a carpool lane with a kickboxing dummy propped up in the passenger seat. The dummy was dressed in a baseball cap and Miami Dolphins windbreaker and wore a seatbelt. In March 2002, a motorist with a full-size mannequin as a passenger drove into the car-pool lane on Interstate 405 in Renton, WA, triggering a chain of collisions involving six cars and two buses. Susan Aeschliman-Hill of Kent, WA, had outfitted her immovable companion with a wig, sweater, and makeup. The accident occurred when Aeschliman-Hill darted into the carpool lane between two buses. Among those injured were fifteen students on a class trip. In 2001, a policeman in Atlanta pulled over a carpool lane violator who'd positioned a dummy in the passenger seat. The mannequin in question was wearing a sports jacket, a pair of sunglasses, and a baseball hat. Best of all, he had been positioned so he was holding a newspaper. Ruses motorists have used to conceal their driving alone in car-pool lanes: Store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, cardboard cut-outs, and even balloons (with faces drawn on them in marking pen). Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat. Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket or placing a doll in it. Taping a styrofoam wig stand to the passenger headrest and topping it with a blonde wig. Strapping the family pooch into the passenger seat. And no, lone hearse drivers transporting clients to their final rests cannot use the diamond lane.

Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender.

In January 2016, the above-displayed photo was posted to various social media sites along with the claim that it showed a baby great white shark. While the animal featured in the photo does resemble a great white, according to marine biologist Alan Holyoak, this is actually a salmon shark. On 28 August 2012, Holyoak and his wife found the stranded salmon shark on a beach in Oregon. The marine biologist wrote about the experience on his blog and posted several additional photos of the animal: At first glance I didn't know exactly what kind of shark this was, but I'd narrowed it down to one of three species: White, Porbeagle (a.k.a. Mackerel), or Salmon shark. These sharks all belong to Family Lamnidae and have geographic ranges that include the Oregon coast. Oh, FYI, this family also includes Mako sharks, but this is clearly not one of those!... ... I decided that it was probably either a Salmon or Porbeagle shark because the coloration and teeth didn't look right for a white shark of this size. Juvenile white sharks are much more common along the southern California coast than they are in Oregon, and young whites tend to have a silvery color along their flanks rather than this clearly distinct dark above and white below color pattern you can see in the photo above... ... Later, after this experience was all over and we were back in our room, I did some checking and this was definitely a juvenile salmon shark, Lamna ditrops. Salmon sharks and great white sharks do have a similar appearance, but the Lamna ditrops doesn't compare in size to the great white. Adult salmon sharks can grow as big as 10 feet long but the average size is about 7 feet. According to National Geographic, great whites are nearly twice that size, with some specimens recorded at more than 20 feet in length.

 {"Origins":"We began seeing this cautionary tale turn up in inboxes in November 2002. Although these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Nonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road). According to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads: The only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late you may have already lost control. An example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence: Dear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic. I have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly. Use of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous. Enjoy your column every week keep up the good work. Sincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y. A: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable. I agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed. For that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver. Wet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting. Likewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out. Barbara \"spin city\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08;","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 2002] I had a wreck a couple of weeks ago and totaled our Lincoln Town Car. I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me. I learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags. The only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents. Be careful out there! [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Some good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat! A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence! When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and youtake off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred. We all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control. The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning. We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries. If you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it. You might have saved a life.","Last Updated":"12 April 2011","Credibility":-1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/techno/wetroad.asp","Claim":"Using cruise control on wet roads or during heavy rain can cause

 {"Origins":"If you have lived as an adult in the same area where you grew up, chances are you can recall at least a few fondly-remembered local landmarks of your childhood that no longer exist places or things that had special significance for you (if only in their familiarity) that have since been removed, replaced, or destroyed. They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.","Fact Check":"","Description":"One such memory of mine is a rather unusual one. It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan. Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence. The landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a 60-foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: The Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California. Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \"[T]he tunnel was an eyesore,\" she said. \"If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?\" Ms. Seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her \"canvas.\" Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti. Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months. (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.) Finally, at 8:00 PM on Friday, 28 October 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the Lynne Seemayer Westmore cliff with brushes and paint cans. By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand. For the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road. But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts. She was also deemed to be a serious traffic hazard. Foreseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go. Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin. (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.) Only after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work. (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.) As the Los Angeles Times reported twenty-five years later: Westmore arrived on the scene, and was horrified. She had assumed that she would feel no sentimental attachment to the Pink Lady, but would easily forget her as with other art projects and move on to the next. But when she saw the road crew trying to erase her work, her emotionschanged. \"I usually don't have a feeling that everything I do is precious,\" Westmore said. \"But in this case, I became its mother, and it became important for me to save her. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen.\" There was little Westmore could do. She had always wondered if the painting might land her in jail, and the county's response only heightened that concern. She stayed silent. Finally, when she realized the only way to stop the lady's removal was a court injunction, she went public. She appealed to [county Road Division head I. L.] Morhar to stop the proceedings. It made no difference. Neither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady. On Thursday, 3 November 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with 14 gallons of brown paint. (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.) County workers paint over the Pink Lady, 3 November 1966 Although Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative. She sued Los Angeles County for $$1 million over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $$26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the \"public nuisance\" she created. (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.) On the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the Los Angeles Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal: \"As I was leaving that day,\" said Westmore, who couldn't bear to watch her creation be removed, \"this woman came up to me and said, 'Let me just touch you.' That's when I knew this was starting to get out of hand.\" Another woman called Westmore every other night for two months, contending that the Pink Lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home. \"She thought I had used her daughter as a model,\" Westmore said. \"It was so pathetic. She was so convinced.\" Westmore received hate mail from people offended by the nude portrait, including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at Sunset Boulevard. She turned the letter over to the FBI. She received pictures of men masturbating. An arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted. \"It was too crazy,\" she said. \"One woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed, that the Pink Lady brought out the lust in men.\" Westmore changed her telephone number, but the calls kept coming. Finally, the stress was too much, and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary. But even in the hospital she wasn't immune from attention. \"This nurse came in, wanting me to sign something,\" Westmore recalled. \"I thought it was for some kind of medical work, but she wanted an autograph.\" In the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art to \"do something that was [her] own.\" (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.) I never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself. My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime. Somehow that made her all the more intriguing.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"17 May

 {"Origins":"This warning was first seen on the Internet in October 1997. According to a 12 December 1997 message sent out by NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System) at the request of the Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin: NHTSA states that they have been unable to confirm any instances of a slimjim triggering a side-impact airbag. NHTSA further states that the vehicle manufacturers state that it is impossible to deploy an airbag using a slimjim. NHTSA has been haunted by this hoax since it first appeared. It has issued multiple bulletins to the effect that no deaths or slimjim-triggered airbag incidents have been reported, but apparently to no avail, as the warning continues to circulate.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Barbara \"error bag\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 1998] ******SAFETY NOTICE****** One of the traditional services provided to the motoring public by Police Agencies and tow truck operators involves assisting those operators who unwittingly lock their keys inside their vehicles. Several types of devices are on the market which allow an officer, or tow truck operator, to unlock the vehicle by sliding a metal rod, commonly known as a \"slim jim\", between the door window and frame in order to access the control rods which unlock the door lock and handle. Once unlocked, the owner can enter the vehicle and retrieve the keys. Many devices have successfully been used for this purpose, including the well known coat hanger. On Wednesday, December 3rd, the following Officer Safety notice was received at our Clifton Park, NY D&H District office via the New York Statewide Police Information Network. *****MOTOR VEHICLE ALERT**********CAUTION***** While attempting to gain entry to a vehicle with side impact airbags in a lockout, at least three Law Enforcement Officials have been killed using a Slim Jim Device. Inadvertent deployment of the airbag can cause the slim jim to be launched upward with great force. The force is strong enough to cause the device to penetrate the chin of the person attempting to access the vehicle, after which it can continue on to become lodged in the brain. Even when lockout assistance efforts do not prove to be deadly, the damage costs can be significant and may include thousands of dollars for replacement of the dashboard, which is designed to breakaway so as not to harm the driver or front passenger. The wiring for many of these side impact airbags is not shielded in any way, so a car opening tool can easily damage the wiring, causing malfunction or possible deployment of the airbag.Employees who find themselves in a situation where they need to get into a locked vehicle should be aware of the possible danger of deployment of the airbags for their own safety as well as the safety of others.","Last Updated":"29 March 2011","Credibility":-1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/hazards/slimjim.asp","Claim":"Police officers coming to the aid of motorists locked out of their cars are dying in

 {"Origins":"On 10 November 2015, the History Channel aired a special entitled Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured, a program that purportedly documented a successful hunt and capture of the legendary creature:","Fact Check":"","Description":"Bigfoot is America's most legendary creature, and has always inspired more questions than answers. Could something resembling a massive man-ape really be roaming forests and hiding in the shadows undetected? Whether you believe in Bigfoot or not, there's something provocative about the idea that we could be living with an unseen monster. But what if one day we did more than catch a glimpse of one? What if we captured the creature? This two-hour special, compiled by a director who traveled the world looking for proof Bigfoot actually exists, takes an unexpected turn when a Sasquatch capture is caught on camera. What happens when what most of us think is fiction becomes fact? And what does it mean for us all if the creature really is out there. While the program started with a brief disclaimer stating that Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured featured \"some dramatization\" and ended with credits listing various actors who pretended to be Bigfoot hunters, the episode was presented in documentary form and therefore fooled a number of viewers into believing that a Bigfoot creature had actually been captured during the process of filming. This is not the case. The actors on \"Bigfoot Captured\" didn't actually catch a Sasquatch or uncover a Bigfoot skeleton. According to the Idaho State Journal, the History Channel contracted Idaho State University's Robotics and Communication Systems Engineering Technology program to create a skeleton of the mythical beast to be used in the show: Because no actual Bigfoot skeletons have been unearthed, [ISU anthropology and anatomy professor Jeff] Meldrum had to reconstruct it based on what Bigfoot researchers believe the creature is related to. Meldrum borrowed from the physical looks of extinct animals such as the Gigantopithecus blacki an ancient ape that was twice the size of apes today and the Neanderthal a species of human that is said to have became extinct 40,000 years ago. Meldrum took the Neanderthal skeleton, and technicians from the Idaho Virtualization Laboratory on ISU's campus under Meldrum's guidance digitally manipulated the skeleton to reflect the Bigfoot captured in the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. \"They made the shoulders much broader, the torso thicker, the arms longer, the legs the right proportion,\" Meldrum said. \"Then we took the Neanderthal skull away because it's more human-like.\" In other words, Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured was not a documentary, but rather a fictional work created in fake documentary style for entertainment purposes, just like the fake Animal Planet \"documentary\" on mermaids and the fake Discovery Channel \"documentary\" about megalodon.

 {"Origins":"In October 2015, a Facebook user shared the above-reproduced image of a sign marking the former town of Belakwa, New York, which was supposed;y abandoned in 2012 after \"a 'routine' hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreparable,\" along with a comment stating: Oh, yeah. Fracking is totally harmless.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Iterations of the image (and the sign's claims that Belakwa, New York had been abandoned due to hydrofracking) date to at least 2013, when photographs of the sign were circulated on social media with additional context: ON THIS SITE STOOD the town of BELAKWA, NY. It was abandoned in 2012 after a \"routine\" hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreprable. \"Belakwa\" = \"Bella Aqua\" = \"Beautiful Water\" Great new street art project being done in upstate NY. This siting is in Bearsville, NY outside of Woodstock, NY. As the poster correctly observed, the sign was part of a larger series of works by artist Norm Magnusson. In 2007, the New York Times profiled Magnusson's eye-catching project, rendered in the style of the state's iconic historical markers: The blue and yellow sign along Main Street in Ridgefield looked a lot like a historical marker, but something wasn t quite right. Rather than commemorate a famous person who had stood there, or an event that had shaped history, the marker honored the role of dissent in the functioning of a \"healthy democracy.\" Mr. Magnusson is an artist-activist. His cast aluminum markers focus our attention on pressing contemporary social and political issues, often restating the concerns or comments of ordinary Americans in carefully composed messages that are designed to make you think. Magnusson's subject matter is exceedingly broad, ranging across a variety of topical issues, including global warming, the war in Iraq and the debate over evolution and intelligent design. His candor is pitiless and unsparing, showing no fear or favor to any particular ideology. Magnusson's work utilizes a standard format for historical markers in New York State: No town or other settlement by the name of Belakwa ever existed in New York State. A Google Maps search on the location returned a result pointing to the museum in which Magnusson's work was displayed.

 {"Origins":"Looks good, doesn't it? This suggested dodge for getting around the paying traffic fines has been in circulation on the Internet since 1998. Over the years, it has been re-worked and sent about as helpful heads-up to Americans, Australians, and Canadians, each time with the wording of the \"advice\" re-tooled to make it appear applicable to whichever country was being named in the boondoggle. Multiple versions of the basic mailing now exist, with the one cited as the second example most commonly used as the template from which others are created (via changing the spellings of words and swapping in acronyms specific to the target country).","Fact Check":"","Description":"As to why people want to believe in the proposed stratagem, the scheme described makes sense, and in its original form it even provided a source .

Is the procedure described by the message valid, though? Well, examining an earlier description of this message may yield some clues: This is an interesting and, I am sure for all you petrol heads an invaluable tip (which I know works). If you find that you have got a speeding ticket or you have gone through a red light or what ever you do to lose demerit points from your license, I have heard of a method to ensure that you DON'T lose any points. It is this: When you get your fine, send a check to pay it, and if the fine is, say $$79, then make the cheque out for $$82 or some small amount above the fine. The system will then have to send you a cheque back for the difference so eventually you get a cheque for $$3. Now, here is the trick DON'T cash the check throw it away. Demerit points are not removed from your license until all of the financial transactions are complete. If you don't cash the cheque then the transactions are not complete, however, the system has got its money so it is happy and doesn't bother you anymore. Source: Rick Thoonen Production Administrator RACV Touring Publications The funny spelling (to Americans, at least) of \"cheque\" and the quaint reference to \"petrol\" in this version should tell us something. And the better separation in the \"Source:\" section gives us the full name, job title, and an acronym for the place of employment of our source. Sounds pretty good so far. But just what, we wonder, does the acronym RACV mean? The \"funny\" spelling noted above was a hint: it's the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, a state in Australia. This message from the Land Down Under was unwittingly or otherwise \"repackaged\" for American consumption (by someone obviously unaware of the meaning of the source cited), so right away you can cast off any notion that this scheme is going to work in one of the United States of America, much less all of them. Does this scheme at least work in Victoria, then? Even if this worked at one time, it probably didn't work for long given all the publicity the message quoted above generated. In fact, our Australian sources inform us that not only does this point-avoidance method not work now, it never worked in the first place. You can overpay your traffic ticket if you like, but the only result will be that you'll contribute some extra money to the general revenue fund. Later versions of the message claimed: This information came to our attention from a very reliable computer company that sets up the standard database used by each states' DMV. You have to wonder about a \"very reliable computer company\" that puts a glaring loophole in its customers' systems, then tells the world about it. The fact is, every state does not use a \"standard database\" set up by a single company. (Even if any state's system did have such a loophole, they've now had three years' worth of people circulating this message on the Internet to warn them about it.) Some people assert they've tried this scheme and it worked, and though it's certainly possible some people who overpaid their traffic tickets never saw any points go on their records, most likely that was a result of coincidence, not cause-and-effect. As most anyone who's dealt with the DMV knows, things do slip through the cracks now and then, just rarely in your favor. If you feel that spending three extra dollars in the hopes of keeping a ticket off your record is a worthwhile gamble, go ahead and try it. You're likely to be disappointed with the results, though.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 1998] I tried to pass this on to anyone I could think of.

 {"Origins":"In September 2015, several web sites published articles claiming that Jack Nicholson was \"positively against\" abortion: \"I m very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I m positively against it. I don t have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life.\"","Fact Check":"Did Jack Nicholson say that he was \"positively against\" abortion?","Description":"This short statement is full of humility, wisdom, and courage. Note that he says, I don t have the right to any other view. He has understood, thanks to the knowledge that his own life almost never happened, that life is a gift for which we should all feel gratitude. His willingness to vocally oppose abortion in the face of Hollywood and his own political party is inspiring and should be encouraged. While these articles were presented as current news stories, that is not the case. Nicholson's statement comes from a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone magazine in which the actor talked about his complicated family life. During the interview, Nicholson said that he was \"positively against\" abortion since his mother June nearly decided to end her pregnancy: I'm very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I'm positively against it. I don't have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life. If June and Ethel had been of less character, I would never have gotten to live. These women gave me the gift of life. It's a feminist narrative in the very pure form. Despite Nicholson's comments to Rolling Stone in 1984, the actor told the Washington Post in 1990 that while he was personally against abortion he still considered himself to be politically pro-choice: \"I'm pro-choice but against abortion because I'm an illegitimate child myself and it would be hypocritical to take any other position. I'd be dead. I wouldn't exist,\" the star and director of \"The Two Jakes\" said in a Washington Post interview. \"And I have nothing but total admiration, gratitude and respect for the strength of the women who made the decision they made in my individual case. But as I say, I believe this is the choice of the woman and, you know, I walk it like I talk it.\" Nicholson was 38 when he learned that his \"mother\" was really his grandmother and that the woman he had known as his sister was in fact his mother. While Jack Nicholson did say that he was \"positively against\" abortion, his comment was made decades ago and doesn't fully address the actor's more nuanced views on the subject.

 {"Origins":"On 23 September 2015 the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) published an article titled \"Texas: 14-Year Old Virgin Falls Pregnant After Flu Shot\" which reported that: A 14-year old schoolgirl has suffered serious complications after a flu shot allegedly left the young girl terribly ill and with severe cramps, until the family doctor finally realized weeks later she had been impregnated by the vaccine, reports the Forth Worth Telegram this week.","Fact Check":"Did a 14-year-old girl become pregnant after receiving a flu shot?","Description":"She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. It s not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents, but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy, and she urged me to check her hymen, which I eventually did, and to my utter surprise, the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm she assures. In my 26 years of practice, I have never heard once of such a thing as someone being impregnated by a vaccine, but I did some research and found out it is more common than most people think . The claim cleverly layered the suggestion of a falsehood within its own fabrication to facilitate the spread of the story; by that sleight of hand, readers surmised the girl had lied about her sexual experience and had blamed the flu vaccine to deflect suspicion about the true nature of her pregnancy. None of this (neither the girl's claims nor the article reporting them) was true, however. World News Daily Report is just one of many fake news sites that print fictitious articles, as noted in their disclaimer: WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. World News Daily Report previously spread fake news stories about loggers accidentally cutting down the world's largest tree, Yoko Ono's admitting to an affair with Hillary Clinton, and a 179-year-old man living in India.

 {"Origins":"This is a windfall legend, pure and simple, a tale of an ordinary Joe's being in the right place at the right time to have good fortune handed to him. We want to believe in the legendary Harley because then we can believe magic could touch any of us at any time. And in that lies the key to this legend's tellability.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Most often this legend is told about a machine inscribed \"To Elvis, Love, Priscilla,\" but sometimes the bike is said to have been a gift from Elvis to James Dean. How much was paid for it is also subject to variation; anything from $$300,000 to $$2.2 million has been mentioned. The buyer is either said to be the Harley-Davidson Company or Jay Leno (of \"Tonight Show\" fame). (An Elvis Presley-James Dean pairing is rather unlikely because at the time of James Dean's death in an automobile accident on 30 September 1955, neither young man was yet a major entertainment figure. The two films that propelled James Dean to stardom, Giant and Rebel Without a Cause , were released posthumously, and in September 1955 Elvis Presley was still largely a regional act, recording for a small Memphis-based record label and playing live shows around the South at venues that included high school gyms. At that point in his career, Elvis would probably not have lavished such an expensive gift on someone who was then only a relatively minor TV and film star.) Jay Leno has categorically stated his only connection with this tall tale is people asking him about it: Have you heard the story about the Rockingham County farmer who bought an old Harley-Davidson motorcycle at a yard sale and discovered \"To Elvis, Love Priscilla\" written under the seat? Then he sold it to Jay Leno, late-night talk show host, who handed over $$1 million for the bike? Well, Leno has heard it. \"Yesterday, I got a call that it was an old farmer in Pennsylvania that had it,\" he said. \"Then, two weeks ago, Texas Monthly magazine called because I'd bought it from a farmer (there).\" Leno has one thing to say: \"I don't buy show-business memorabilia.\" In 2000, Leno said he had been getting a couple of calls a week for the past six to eight months about the story, which he called \"an urban fairy tale\" perpetuated, in part, by the Internet. On 22 January during that evening's airing of The Tonight Show , he once again disclaimed the rumor. Additionally, Todd Morgan, a spokesman at Graceland in Memphis, said none of the long-lost Harley stories was true. If not Leno, maybe the Harley-Davidson Company bought the bike? Nope. They've less need than anyone to buy an Elvis motorcycle now, because they already have one. A 1956 Harley-Davidson KH that belonged to The King and was purchased from Fleming Horne by Harley-Davidson in 1995 is now housed at their archive facility in Milwaukee. Elvis had other motorcycles too, five of which (four Harleys and one Honda) are at the Graceland Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. Harley-Davidson has lots of fun trying to set people straight about this legend. A 1996 newspaper article relates the difficulties they've had: First, the undead Elvis was seen all across America. A St. Louis housewife even saw the King at a movie theater here. I read that in a supermarket tabloid, so I know it's true. Now Elvis' Harley is turning up all around the USA. The King's hog brings fabulous wealth to the fan who finds it. I'm proud to say I have the Harley bike story worth the most money $$4 million. That number is confirmed by the Harley-Davidson folks. I heard the story from my friend Richard, who believes it is true. \"This could only happen in America,\" he said. Here is Richard's story: \"This friend of a friend of my daughter was riding along a back road, when he saw an old motorcycle for sale,\" Richard said. \"It was a 1950s Harley for $$600. The bike needed work, but he bought it. \"He couldn't get parts, the bike was so old. So he called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee. He described the Harley. He kept getting transferred from person to person. Each time, they'd ask what the Harley looked like. \"Finally, the CEO of Harley came on the line. He asked the guy to describe the Harley again. Then he told him to go out and check under the rear fender. That's where he found an inscription beginning, 'To Elvis ...' \"It was Elvis' Harley-Davidson, a gift from somebody. Harley offered him $$4 million for it. \"Imagine that,\" Richard said. \"Four million dollars for a bike he found by the road. It's like winning the lottery.\" Is there a chance in a million that this story is true? Elvis collectibles go for major money. His 1969 American Express card was auctioned for $$41,400. And it was expired. Elvis only held it in his hand. Think what you could get for something he'd wrapped his legs around. Elvis did ride Harleys, and he rode them hard. Lamar Fike, a member of the Memphis Mafia Elvis' entourage says he and Elvis used to ride their Harleys 110 miles an hour on what is now Elvis Presley Boulevard. One misty afternoon in 1957, they had to slow down for a bus. Lamar and his Harley slid under the bus. Lamar was lucky. He only lost some leather off his jacket. He lived to tell this story to Alanna Nash for her book, Elvis Aaron Presley. Elvis' Harley was untouched. Was it the one Richard's friend of a friend found on a back road? Richard tried to find the new Harley millionaire for me. \"He was the friend of other friends,\" Richard said. \"Nobody knows his name.\" If I just got $$4 million, I'd keep my name quiet, too. Richard was sure Harley-Davidson would remember this high-priced buy. I called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee and got transferred from person to person, just like the guy in the story. I didn't end up with the Harley CEO. I got Nola Vander Meulen with Harley public relations. \"We've received so many calls on the Elvis Harley,\" she said. Is the story true? \"No, it's an urban legend. We hear about it all the time, from all over. Usually the Harley is found in a barn or bought at a garage sale. The buyer lifts up the seat or looks at the fender and sees this inscription: 'To Elvis, from Priscilla.' Most stories say we buy it for anywhere from half a million to a million dollars. You came up with the most money.\" There is some truth to the tale. \"We did purchase Elvis' very own personal Harley,\" Nola said. \"But it belonged to a collector who knew what it was. The bike was well documented.\" How much did Harley pay for it? \"I don't know, and if I did, I couldn't say.\" Four million dollars? I asked. Nola laughed and laughed, which I took for a no. The Harley bike story does skid by the truth. But the actual facts are a King-sized disappointment. The legendary Elvis deserves better. I can only hope that somewhere there is an undiscovered Harley. I'll ask Elvis, next time he's in town to see a movie. A similar tale circulates concerning country singer Hank Williams, who died of a heart attack on New Year s Day of 1953 while sleeping in the back seat of his Cadillac: A guy is walking alone one night and sees a parked car with a man passed out in the backseat. The window is unrolled and the man manages to swipe the backseat sleeper's large white hat. The next morning he hears that Hank Williams was found dead in the backseat of a car. The man flips the hat upside-down only to notice the letters \"H.W.\" inscribed in the rim. Hank Williams's hat was never found and to this day it sits in this guy's closet. (Though the Elvis Harley tale isn't one of them, some windfall legends turn out to be true. One bargain hunter struck pay dirt when he bought a painting for $$4 at the local flea market. See our Declaration of Financial Independence page for details.)

This is supposed to improve the graduation rate for young, black men by enabling them to spend more time with each other. It seems a bit \"hinky\" to me. It's not being covered by any mainstream news outlets, and a visit to UCONN's website, while it reveals several initiatives for Black History Month, doesn't say a word. This looks like it needs some of your famous debunking. For me, it doesn't quite pass the \"sniff test.\" There are lots of Google links to be had by searching for \"uconn black dorm,\" but as I said, none seem reliable. Thanks!! An all black dorm? Boy this country has really gone to hell in recent years after we elected a black president. Race... Posted by John F Gallagher on Sunday, January 31, 2016 An all black dorm? Boy this country has really gone to hell in recent years after we elected a black president. Race... Posted by John F Gallagher on Sunday, January 31, 2016 Origin:On 31 January 2016, The Blaze published an article with a headline indicating that the University of Connecticut was building a dorm to house black students only: In order to help black males graduate, the University of Connecticut is constructing a dorm with a living space only for them. Called the ScHOLA2RS House, the living community for African American males is set to open in 2016. According to UConn's website, the ScHOLA2RS House is \"a scholastic initiative to groom, nurture, and train the next generation of leaders to address grand challenges in society through the promotion of academic success in undergraduate programs at the University of Connecticut and in competitive graduate programs.\" Fox News' Fox Nation aggregated a snippet of a separate web site's article on the same date, with the sole visible excerpt stating that: The University of Connecticut is hoping that black males will graduate at a higher rate if they spend more time with one another, and is building a new residence hall to facilitate just that. Many readers expressed skepticism regarding the accuracy of the claim and reported an inability to locate any such initiative announced or described on UConn's web site or the school's social media channels. We contacted UConn's Residential Life department to ask whether any construction for a \"blacks only\" dorm was underway. They confirmed the only new housing being built was for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) students of all ethnicities. An undated document published among UConn's learning initiatives included a \"Mission\" portion that read: ScHOLA RS House is a Learning Community designed to support the scholastic efforts of male students who identify as African American/Black through academic and social/emotional support, access to research opportunities, and professional development. The intent of this Learning Community is to increase the retention and persistence of students using educational and social experiences to enhance their academic success at UConn and beyond in graduate and professional school placement. ScHOLA RS House will encourage involvement with the larger university community to foster peer and mentor relationships and will actively engage students in inclusion efforts at UConn. Some of the material from that document appeared to be the source for articles about a \"blacks-only dorm\" linked above. However, a question and answer section of that document expressly stated that ScHOLA RS program participants wouldn't be living in a facility where they were segregated from other students: If I apply to live in ScHOLA RS House, will I be segregated from the rest of campus? No. Typically, students do not spend their days in their residence hall. Students are in classes across campus, they participate in student organizations, they apply for leadership opportunities and work in offices across campus, they study in the library, they share meals in several dining halls, and so forth. A student s Learning Community is simply a cohort of students they engage in activities with, such as they would if they joined another organization. It will not encompass a student s entire college experience. What it will do is provide a group of faculty, staff and students who support each other and encourage the success of its members academically, professionally, and socially. In addition, the 40 ScHOLA RS House students will live on a floor of over 100 students, so they will engage easily with students from all backgrounds in their residence hall. A separate portion of the document explained that the cohort would be housed together along with other learning communities: Students who apply to participate in the ScHOLA RS House program will live in NextGen Hall, sharing a floor with Innovation House students. NextGen Hall will house over 700 students participating in 8 Learning Communities, providing ample opportunity to engage with students from across majors, interests, and backgrounds: EcoHouse; Engineering House; Eurotech House; STEM Honors House; Innovation House; ScHOLA RS House; Public Health House; and WiMSE House (Women in Math, Science & Engineering). Each Learning Community is led by a team, including a faculty director, graduate assistants, a residence hall director, student resident assistants, and student mentors. Students participating enroll in a one-credit Learning Community-themed FYE (first year experience) course or a one-credit sophomore course and engage in activities throughout the academic year. We contacted UConn's Dr. Erik Hines for clarification on the rumor, and he provided a number of details omitted in circulating news reports: Twelve students already have contacted us with interest in living in Scholars House. Participation is, of course, entirely voluntary and its programming will be open to all in the University community, not only black male students. This living community will also be located in the new Next Gen Hall when it opens this fall, so Scholars House students will live among 700-plus other students from all backgrounds while at the same time having access to specialized educational and social experiences to encourage success in their college careers. To correct misinformation that some have unwittingly spread, this learning community will not be separate, nor is the building only going to house this group of students. Rather, this will be one of several learning communities whose residents live in Next Gen Hall, along with other students who aren't in learning communities. Also to clarify, this is not UConn's first learning community with a focus on a specific race or gender. For instance, La Comunidad Intelectual is a thriving community in Brock Hall, and WiMSE (Women in Math, Science and Engineering), located in Watson Hall, is one of our first and consistently most popular. If other students are interested in a similar residential experience, we are always open to looking at more communities to add to those already on campus. In fact, we've made a commitment to expand our learning communities, so we encourage students to bring their ideas to us, and to help us develop the kinds of housing experiences they would find valuable. The claim that UConn was constructing a special dorm for black students only was false: The learning community ScHOLA RS House is only one of many such academic communities on campus, participants aren't required to be black, and it is open to anyone who wants to be a part of it.

 {"Origins":"On 10 October 2015, the web site Jews News published the above-displayed photograph along with a brief story about \"Captain Balislava,\" supposedly a female Russian Federation fighter pilot who bombed ISIS: Meet Captain Balislava, a Russian federation fighter pilot who bombed the hell out of ISIS yesterday. The only thing better than watching ISIS get the hell beat out of them, is knowing a female is doing it because as you know, terrorists think they don t go to Heaven if a woman kills them!\"","Fact Check":"Does a photograph show Captain Balislava, a female Russian federation fighter pilot who bombed ISIS?","Description":"The photograph and story simply don't match up. If \"Captain Balislava\" is a Russian federation fighter pilot, then why is she holding a helmet painted with Brazilian national colors? And why are the words on the plane behind her neither Russian in language nor written using Cyrillic script? The answer to these questions is simple: the woman pictured above is Brazilian model Ana Hickmann posing for a photo shoot intended to promote the Brazilian Air Force. Hickmann is not a member of any military force and is certainly not \"Captain Balislava\" of the Russian Federation. The above-displayed photograph has been circulating online since at least 2008 and is frequently included in galleries featuring \"sexy military women\" (even though Hickmann is a model, not an actual military pilot).

 {"Origins":"After 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris a number of social media rumors circulated about Syrian refugees; the above-reproduced photograph (published to Facebook on 14 September 2015) became popular among social media claims. While the photograph included little information about the two images it encompassed, the message of it was clear. At the top, purported Syrian refugees enjoyed luxury accommodations at an unnamed hotel; at the bottom, an American veteran and his dog were left to survive on the streets.","Fact Check":"","Description":"The top image was originally published by the British tabloid Express on 28 September 2014 (more than a year before its November 2015 popularity), along with an article titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers fund migrants B&B rooms in top holiday destinations.\" The paper held: The Daily Express has learned that beleaguered Home Office officials have turned to Britannia Hotels, one of the UK s largest groups, to solve the UK s growing asylum epidemic. Coach loads of African and Arab refugees have checked in to the three-star Heathlands and Roundhouse hotels in Britain s premier destination resort while their claims for asylum are processed. The asylum seekers arrived here illegally, the majority via the Port of Calais, which is now home to 2,000 would-be illegal immigrants from a rainbow nation of war-torn countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Whether or not those claims were accurate, a few things stood out. One was that the image depicted purported asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. As such, whatever their housing arrangements might have been, it bore little relevance to the plight of homeless American veterans. While an objection could be raised about the strategy of sheltering refugees in hotels overall, it isn't as if those British bed & breakfast rooms could have been used to get American servicemen off the streets of the U.S. The Express claimed asylum seekers enjoyed luxury accommodations, but the hotel the paper named maintained a very low 2.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Nightly lodging rates for the property started at a miserly $$52 a night, and travelers described it as \"cheap,\" \"run-down,\" in need of \"renovations,\" \"shabby,\" \"grubby,\" and \"the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.\" Several were moved to share pictorial representations of the luxury they enjoyed as non-refugee guests of the hotel: Moreover, the original article didn't reference the 2015 flood of refugees from Syria. It identified the asylum seekers in question as primarily from Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. On 9 October 2014, Bournemouth's Daily Echo published an article titled \"Red Cross worker: the real story of the asylum seekers' \"seaside holiday\" in Bournemouth.\" According to that piece, the original claims were distorted and deliberately misleading: Enjoying a seaside break in luxury, complete with swimming pools and champagne: these are some of the ways the plight of asylum seekers being housed in hotels on the south coast have been described in recent weeks. As a British Red Cross worker, I d like to share with you what I saw. Last week, we arranged for an elderly woman to be taken to A&E because she had not eaten for three days. She was so weak she couldn t even walk. After the group were dropped off at the hotel, it took four days before anyone, including the local authority and the Red Cross, found out ... The hospital raised the alarm when two asylum seekers presented themselves at A&E. And that s when we were called in. We provided basics such as clothes, nappies and female sanitary products, as well as facilitating access to doctors, midwives and health visitors ... At the Red Cross, we support refugees and asylum seekers every day but I ve never seen so many people treated like this before. While it's true that asylum seekers were temporarily housed in a bed & breakfast in Bournemouth in 2014, the meme created the misleading impression that such accommodation was had at the expense of American veterans' care. The image was in fact purportedly taken in Britain in 2014, originally published as part of an anti-refugee missive. A Red Cross worker later stepped forward to clarify that the individuals housed in travel lodging were weak and ill upon their arrival in Britain, not enjoying the amenities of a free vacation. Moreover, whether the images truly depicted asylum seekers or merely involved three non-British vacation-goers remained to be seen. The Express didn't elaborate as to how they determined that the asylum seekers in question were the fellows depicted in the image. In any event, the actual asylum seekers temporarily staying in Bournemouth in no way detracted from resources available to veterans in the United States.

 {"Origins":"A photograph purportedly showing First Lady Michelle Obama wearing a shirt bearing the clenched fist symbol associated with the revolutionary black nationalist Black Panther group has been circulating online for several years:","Fact Check":"Does a photograph show Michelle Obama sporting a Black Panther shirt?","Description":"While the exact origin of the above-displayed image is uncertain (the earliest iteration we've uncovered so far was posted to the web site Rump Roast in 2010), it is clearly a digitally altered version of an otherwise innocuous photograph. The original picture was taken during the First Lady's visit to the Gulf Coast after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. At the time, some publications criticized the first lady for wearing what resembled an \"oil spill\" shirt: A Getty Images photograph from the same event shows Michelle Obama's shirt from another angle (as well as other women wearing somewhat similar black-and-white patterned garb): View image | gettyimages.com This isn't the first time that a fake image supposedly documenting the Obamas' alleged affinity for the Black Panther party has circulated online. In September 2009, another manipulated photograph purportedly showing a young Barack Obama posing as a Black Panther made the Internet rounds.

 {"Origins":"On 7 November 2015, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a photo gallery showing the inside of the home owned by former neurosurgeon and current 2016 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. While the gallery featured several images of paintings, awards, and certificates on the walls of Dr. Carson's house, one particular portrait of Dr. Carson posing with Jesus caught the eye of social media users: Ben Carson's house is filled with his awards and pictures, like this one of him with Jesus https://t.co/8GItclguFg pic.twitter.com/k2slHIYRfw","Fact Check":"","Description":"Peter Feld (@peterfeld) November 7, 2015 Some people found the choice of home decor peculiar, and since many viewers came across the portrait of Dr. Ben Carson and Jesus through social media posts and not via a news article, many of them wondered if the photograph was real. While we haven't been able to locate an image of the portrait other than the one offered by the Guardian, we were able to track down confirmation from another publication that a portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus did indeed hang on the neurosurgeon's walls. In 2009, Baltimore Magazine published a profile of Carson which included a description of his home, referenced the portrait in question, and noted that the imagery of the picture was consistent with Dr. Carson's expressions of faith: The family room, where Carson likes to unwind over games of pool, ping pong, and foosball, is a sort of makeshift museum of the man known for his gifted hands, and [his wife] Candy is both keeper and curator. A quick glance at the cases and walls reveals more than 50 honorary doctorate degrees from such institutions as Spelman College, Morgan State University, and Yale as well as certificates, trophies, and statues from numerous preeminent organizations. The [couple's] strong faith is also a guiding force. \"We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,\" says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. \"I don't have to be politically correct here.\" He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" Proverbs 22:4.

 {"Origins":"Once upon a time, traffic enforcement officials could track and cite speeding motorists only by following them in patrol vehicles for prescribed distances and estimating the offenders' speeds in comparison to their own. The development of radar guns allowed police to remain stationary alongside roadways and still catch speeders (as well as measuring their rate of travel more accurately). Then the advent of speed cameras (which use radar to track passing cars and automatically snap pictures of vehicles traveling in excess of speed limits) almost entirely removed humans from the process of catching speeders.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Now, many privacy advocates have been fearing that the next logical step will be the issuance of tickets to motorists who weren't actually caught in the act of speeding by either a human being or a speed-measuring device rather, drivers will be cited by \"average-speed cameras\" or \"point-to-point\" systems that track and photograph their progress between checkpoints through the use of some form of tag carried by drivers or their automobiles, record their elapsed times of passage between those checkpoints, use that information to estimate whether vehicles had to have been traveling in excess of speed limits at any portion of their journeys, and (if so) automatically issue citations. Such a scheme would prevent habitually speeding drivers from avoiding detection by learning the locations of speed traps and ordinary photo radar cameras and slowing down in their proximity. The \"camera tracking\" scenario raises concerns that citizens might have to defend themselves against citations that do not detail where, when, and by how much they were speeding, and warnings about that possibility circulated widely in 2007 (in the form of a rumor that New York would be using E-ZPass transponders or RFID chips embedded within vehicle registration stickers to catch speeders). A similar rumor was floated in mid-2009, one which claimed Florida would be replacing the call boxes along its interstate highways with cameras which would snap pictures of passing cars and issue tickets to those determined to have passed between two call boxes too quickly for the given speed limit. However, the implementation of such a system in any state is not imminent. As of June 2009 only two states in the U.S., Maryland and Arizona, were using any form of photo enforcement cameras on freeways , and Arizona shut down their freeway cameras in July 2010. Camera enforcement programs in California and Florida \"were dismantled after they were found to be operating outside of state law,\" and thirteen other states have laws specifically banning the use of freeway cameras. And all of the highway speed camera systems that have been tried so far in various states have been ordinary radar-camera combinations, not \"point-to-point\" systems that time drivers' progress between checkpoints and calculate an average speed. Although it's not completely beyond the pale of possibility that Florida or some other state might roll out a freeway speed camera system someday, legal and technical hurdles currently preclude the proposition cited in the first example quoted above that Florida will be replacing all its interstate call boxes with tracking cameras by June of 2010. In response to our inquiry to the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT), a representative with the Intelligent Transportation Systems Section of the DOT's Traffic Engineering and Operations Office told us that: The rumor is not true; the Department will not be replacing the call boxes with cameras to catch speeders. This rumor is not true for several reasons: 1) It is illegal. The Department does not have legislative authority to attach speed enforcement cameras on our call box poles 2) It is technically impossible. The call boxes do not have a dedicated power source which will be needed to operate the cameras. It would be cost prohibitive to run power to all the call boxes, making use of the poles impractical. The call boxes run off of a spring that powers a small generator which generates enough power to send a signal for assistance. The spring is tightened by pulling down a handle on the front of the box when the handle is released, the spring is released, running the generator. Once the signal is sent, the box reverts back to its powerless state. The Connecticut variant of this rumor cited above began circulating in January 2010, falsely attributed to a Danbury [Connecticut] News-Times article by Robert Miller. Likewise, that state's DOT has no legislative authority to issue tickets in such a manner, and the cameras along I-84 are not new and do not time motorists for the purpose of issuing tickets they are ordinary traffic cameras initially installed in the mid-1990s: The [Connecticut] state DOT does have cameras along I-84 and along other highways in the state. It also has radar set up along the road. It's had them both in place for years. [DOT spokesman] Kevin Nursick said the state uses the devices to monitor traffic flow. It can use the cameras to see if there's been an accident. It can use the radar to learn if traffic has suddenly slowed. But neither the DOT nor the Connecticut State Police have ever used this system for law enforcement for catching speeders and issuing tickets. In fact, it's specifically forbidden by state law to do so. \"We cannot use this equipment for law enforcement,\" Nursick said. \"You can't do it without a change in state statutes.'' Another iteration of this item originally circulated back in 2006 maintained that such point-to-point speed devices were in operation along Australia's M5 and M7 motorways: IMPORTANT INFORMATION: The M5 and the M7 are now equipped with Point to Point speed devices. Once you enter the M7 for instance, you pass the e-tag and it beeps. At the same time a camera takes a photo of your car and records the exact time. For those who have exited the M7, they would be aware that upon exit the e-tag system beeps again as you leave. At the same time another camera at that point takes a photo of the car and the time. Then the computer calculates the time it has taken you to travel between the two points and calculates your speed. If you have completed the clocked journey too fast, you are given a speeding ticket. At the present time the speed limit is 100kph and you have a tolerance of 102kph and no more. One fraction over that speed and you are issued with a fine automatically. Also remember that school zone camera;s are not speed tolerant. Anything over, even 41kph, is a fine. This means people will be doing 38kph to avoid any differences in their speedo readings Remember, this is going to be a very costly experience for some drivers. Itis also going to mean vehicles will be travelling at 95kph in order to ensure that no ticket is issued. What a shock some drivers are going to have when they have used this roadway for a week and get a week's worth of tickets BOTH WAYS. Of course your license will also be recalled for three months and you know the rest Take the advice and if you ignore it, remember this email when you pay all those fines. Also, remember that now with the new legislation, fighting a speed camera fines is almost impossible. You must prove the device is faulty and if you are not a technician working on them, you have no chance of beating the fine. Please also take into regard that the Pacific Highway has a set which are recognisable as the large steel frames over the lanes with a speed camera nearby and located some distance up the road is another large metal frame with a speed camera. These new point to point systems are being put onto any and all expressway or highway where vehicles are not able to exit between those points. Westlink M7 quickly debunked this version of the rumor as false as well: Westlink M7 has dismissed a hoax email currently circulating that claims that the motorway has implemented a secret speed fine based on the time a vehicle enters and exits the motorway. Flan Cleary, General Manager of Westlink M7, said that the email was a hoax and that no secret speed enforcement system operates on the Westlink M7. Westlink supports safe driving and urges all motorists to comply with posted speed limits. \"However, the secret speed fine system detailed in the hoax email does not exist,\" Mr Cleary said. \"Speed limits are enforced on the Westlink M7 through the normal policing measures that operate on all NSW roads.\" Mr Cleary said that Westlink will be installing signs that remind motorists that speed cameras are used in NSW. These are the standard speed camera signs seen on roads across the state and do not mean that any new or secret speed system operates on the Westlink M7. It is true, however, that average-speed cameras employing automatic number plate recognition technology have been put into place (at least on a trial basis) in a few locations around the world, primarily in Europe and the UK .","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410539/Drivers-avoid-speeding-tickets--changing-lanes.html;https://web.archive.org/web/20060624005026/http://westlinkm7.com.au/news-Detail.asp?NewsID=80;http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?a=2354&Q=290242;http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/27/2764.asp;http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/06/04/aa.speed.cameras.highways/index.html;","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, July 2009] Starting June 1 2010 All Interstate in Florida, will have the Call boxes (on side of the interstate) replaced with Cameras that will take a picture of your tag at one box, and then another picture as you pass the next.

 {"Origins":"Many a product has gone through the life cycle of development, marketing, and then eventual obsolescence when its manufacturer determined it no longer sold well enough to justify continued production or decided to focus on offering a newer and better version. Upon occasion, however, a discontinued product has retained a strong enough following among a devoted group of aficionados for another company to venture licensing or purchasing the rights from the original manufacturer and resuming production. (One example of this phenomenon occurred when INTV bought the rights to the Intellivision video game system from Mattel, selling off old inventory and then producing new consoles and game cartridges.)","Fact Check":"","Description":"That's the basic idea behind this tale from the original (1975) edition of The People's Almanac , about a group of disenchanted General Motors stylists who left the company and spent ten years between 1958 and 1967 cranking out a few hundred thousand copies of the discontinued 1957 model Chevrolet at a small, private plant in Illinois but the kicker is that they supposedly did all this without the knowledge, cooperation, or consent of General Motors. The story seems a fairly obvious bit of humor chock full of tongue-in-cheek jabs at the auto industry (especially evident in the closing reference to Volkswagen's supposed interest in opening a U.S. plant to produce 1973 Buick Rivieras this was written in 1975, shortly after the Riviera had also undergone a significant and much-criticized design change), but its inclusion in a reference work with no external indicator of its fictional status has led many readers in the years since to take it seriously. For those who prefer a more thorough debunking, we highlight a few of the tale's many implausibilities below: We have found no mention whatsoever of \"Ardell Malowick\" or his scheme of producing '57 Chevies in any source outside of The People's Almanac; not a single book, newspaper, or magazine article about either subject (save for those that simply reference the original People's Almanac story). We've contacted a number of vintage car clubs, including ones that specialize in Chevrolet automobiles from the 1950s, and have yet to find a single person who has owned or seen (even in photographs) one of the faux '57 Chevies, anyone who worked in a dealership that sold them, any mechanic who ever serviced one of them, or anybody employed by the plant that supposedly produced them. The phony Chevy plant in Illinois reportedly turned out 200,000 automobiles in a ten-year period that's 400 cars a week, every week, for ten years! Where did a small group former GM workers raise the capital to start up and run such a massive (and illicit) manufacturing venture, all within the space of a few months? How did the plant's owners/operators, all their employees, and all the auto dealerships engaged in selling the faux '57 Chevies account for the expenses, revenues, income, and taxes associated with a product they couldn't legally make or offer for sale? How did dealers manage to sell, without anyone's noticing, a few hundred thousand cars for which they could establish no valid history or chain of ownership, and which could not be traced by serial number or other identifier to a legitimate manufacturer? We don't know how this tale ended up being published in The People's Almanac : whether the compilers decided to include bit of drollery in the book as lark, or a prankish writer managed to slip a gag past unsuspecting editors, or a gullible researcher was taken in by a tall tale. But the story is indeed a joke, and, judging by the results, a good one at that. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the classic automobile's introduction, CARS Inc. announced in 2006 that they would begin offering newly-[re]built (from original cowls) 1957 Chevrolet convertibles.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.1957chevybody.com/;http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/buick-riviera-history.shtml;http://www.57classicchevy.com/;http://www.intellivisiongames.com/history.asp;","Example":"The 1957 Chevrolet was introduced by General Motors in late 1956, as part of their special Labor Day Sneak Preview of New Cars. The '57 Chevy sported nonfunctional tail fins and excess side trim like most American cars of that era, and it would have passed into obscurity except for the amazing popularity of the design in the years that followed. While the Chevy's competitors disappeared into the junkyards of the nation, the '57 throve, particularly the 2-door Bel-Air model. The car became a favorite of customizers in Southern California, and its popularity spread across the nation. The '57 Chevy has been almost as visible on the highways of America as the Volkswagen, particularly in California and the Midwest. In 1965, the California Department of Motor Vehicles listed 35,000 '57 Chevies on the road an astounding survival rate for an American car (although in 1957, Chevrolet enjoyed total sales of 775,000 units). No other American automobile has survived the years with equal fortitude. However, no other American automobile, with the exception of the limited-production Studebaker Avanti, has enjoyed the unique production facilities of the '57 Chevy. There have been subsequent designs for subsequent Chevrolet model years, but the '57, unlike any other American car and contrary to American industrial practice, enjoyed a manufacturer's run of 10 years. A dedicated group of ex-Chevrolet stylists and franchised used-car salesmen continued to turn out close to 200,000 1957 Chevrolets, focusing on the 2-door Bel-Air model, between the years 1957 and 1967, in a small auto assembly plant located outside Jacksonville, Ill. The enthusiasts, led by ex-General Motors stylist Ardell Malowick, quit GM in mid-1957 when it was learned, to nobody's surprise, that the 1957 design was to be scrapped in favor of the longer, lower, wider '58 Chevy, which replaced the '57's peaked fins with contoured, sublimated fins. Malowick and his associates quickly decamped and purchased their own auto assembly facilities in southern Illinois. However, Malowick was unable to finance the die molds and giant steel presses which GM and Fisher Auto Body used to construct the basic body; rather, Malowick relied on the proved European coach-building technique of pounding body shape out by hand over wooden molds, formed from fiber-glass replicas of the real thing. In this way, some of the imperfections of Fisher's mass production were eliminated. Malowick and associates knew that Chevrolet, which held all legal rights to the design, would not consent to the manufacture of '57 Chevies to compete with their '58s and subsequent models. Perhaps GM was aware, as Malowick now contends, that subsequent models could never compete with the '57 for purity of design. Because of legal restrictions, the post-1957 new '57 Chevies built by Malowick were sold as remarkably well-preserved used cars in car lots across the U.S. In the sale of these cars, Malowick enjoyed the clandestine cooperation of countless used-car merchants throughout the nation who were in sympathy with his cause. Certainly, used car dealers sought Malowick's creations with a fervor they have not displayed for any other American vehicle before or since. Malowick was able to survive financially by his relatively high wholesale price, and a low overhead provided in part by engines and chassis pirated from Chrysler warehouses in northern Illinois (accounting partially for Chrysler's bewildering stock nose dive during and immediately after their \"forward look\" phase), and from sales to special collectors and customizers, mostly in California, who were willing to pay anything for a '57 Chevy in good condition. By far Malowick's most successful model was, of course, the 2-door Bel Air with the metallic plum paint, many which can be seen on the streets of most American cities today. In 1967, Malowick was forced to close down shop because of rising costs and the rumors that General Motors was wise to his operations and was preparing legal action. Malowick has since gone into the business of manufacturing denim boots and book bags, but he is considering another automobile operation if he can locate favorable conditions, possibly in Germany. There is a rumor that the giant Volkswagen Corporation, which has thought about opening a factory in the U.S., has made overtures to Malowick regarding the 1973 Buick Riviera, another classic of American design.","Last Updated":"9 October 2013","Credibility":0,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp","Claim":"A group of former General Motors workers furtively produced 1957 Chevrolet automobiles on their own for ten years.","Tags":"","Prob Model":0,"Claim_ID":"autos_dream_57chevy","Google Results":[{"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/dream.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/search/?q=U.S.%20soldiers%20rape%20boys%20in%20front%20of%20their%20mothers&sort=relevance&order=desc&page=64","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"twitter.com","link":"http://twitter.com/#!/snopes/status/11289983335","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"camelopardid2.rssing.com","link":"http://camelopardid2.rssing.com/chan-1192507/all_p1.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"xishui.co","link":"http://xishui.co/tag/car-dealers-contoured-creations","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com","link":"http://www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.texasmonthly.com","link":"http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/o-janis/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.carlustblog.com","link":"http://www.carlustblog.com/hafner.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"blog.hemmings.com","link":"http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2012/04/24/driving-away-cancer-a-50-state-odyssey-begins/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com","link":"https://therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com/opinion/opinion/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"archive.org","link":"https://archive.org/stream/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25_djvu.txt","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"archive.org","link":"https://archive.org/stream/whitinspindle1961unse/whitinspindle1961unse_djvu.txt","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.gizmag.com","link":"http://www.gizmag.com/abrasive-weeding/41443/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"github.com","link":"https://github.com/robennals/think-link/blob/master/ruby/snopesclaims.csv","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.academia.edu","link":"http://www.academia.edu/3790697/Retro_THE_CULTURE_OF_REVIVAL","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.erudit.org","link":"https://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2014/v25/n1/1032799ar.pdf","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"zineweb.com","link":"http://zineweb.com/?cat=5","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.joesherlock.com","link":"http://www.joesherlock.com/Book-Reviews4.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"weaponsman.com","link":"http://weaponsman.com/?cat=32&paged=9","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"ufdc.ufl.edu","link":"http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00010883/02396","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"aebrain.blogspot.com","link":"http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.alniva.be","link":"http://www.alniva.be/corgi/corgi_historiek.htm","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_dream_57chevy","domain":"www.bibliotecapleyades.net","link":"http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/world_order/WorldCh07-1.htm","link_type":"results"}}]},

While most celebrity death hoaxes stem from fake news reports or humorless pranks, the rumor about actress Ashley Olsen's death was rooted in a real, and tragic, news story. The Associated Press reports that another woman named Ashley Olsen, an American artist and fashionista, was found dead in her apartment in Florence: The American artist and fashionista found dead in her apartment in Italy last week was strangled, according to autopsy results announced by Italian investigators Tuesday. The body of 35-year-old Ashley Olsen was discovered in her Florence home on Saturday. She died as a result of murder by strangulation with either a rope or cord-like object, authorities told reporters. Olsen, who is originally from Summer Haven, Florida, was living in the Oltrarno district of Florence and working in the fashion industry. She left the United States for Italy a few years ago to be close to her father, according to Italian news agency ANSA. In addition to sharing the same name, the former Full House star fit the \"American artist\" description and is also approximately the same age (29) as the murder victim. These similarities led many people to mistakenly believe that the Ashley Olsen who was killed in Italy was the same Ashley Olsen who appeared on the TV show Full House. On 12 January 2016, the artist's friends called for Italian authorities to bring her killer to justice: Olsen's friends demanded for her killer to be brought to justice in a letter that appeared in The Florentine, an English-language news magazine. \"Ashley was a rare and kindhearted spirit.

 {"Origins":"In October 1996, the Internet was left giggling over the hilarious news story of a pair of not-too-bright good ol' boys and truck repairs gone wrong. Combining the key comic elements of trucks, bullets and stupidity, the tale was a sure winner.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Only one problem with the news item: It didn't happen. It was a fun story dressed up to look like a 25 July 1996 Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article, and it fooled a lot of people. It didn't fool the newspaper the fake news item had been attributed to, though. Here's a debunking of the tale by the very paper that supposedly ran the original story: A frog-gigging story that reportedly appeared in this newspaper is winding its way around the globe like a chain letter. Except the story didn't run in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. And from all indications, it's not true. That's not keeping it from circulating the Internet. In fact, the computer network is proving much speedier and far-reaching than most chain letters. Under headings such as \"True-Life Redneck Story\" and \".22 Cal Ammunition Safety Alert!!\" computer users around the United States are passing on the following story (incorrectly listed as appearing in Arkansas Democrat-Gazette July 25): Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on state Highway 38 early Monday morning. Woodruff County Deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc, and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock, are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pickup truck's headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River Bridge. After traveling approximately 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right, exiting the pavement and striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston (shot his intimate parts off) or we might have been dead,\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper for 10 years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how the accident happened,\" said Snyder. Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught, and did anyone get them from the truck. While Lavinia worries over the fate of the frogs, Arkansans worry where the story might have originated. There is no town of Cotton Patch in Woodruff County - it's Cotton Plant. No Deputy Snyder has ever worked for that county's sheriff's department. And attempts at verifying the existence of Wallis and Poole have been futile. Could it have a been an attempt to make Arkansans look stupid? \"I accuse a Yankee of it,\" says one Internet observer. No one has claimed responsibility. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ran that piece out of self-defense it kept getting calls and inquiries about the bullet fuse story, and this seemed the best way to try to put a lid on the spurious story. Where did the tale come from? It was likely a fanciful reworking of an earlier version that had appeared on the Internet in March 1996: Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was a perfect fit). However, when electricity heated the bullet, it went off and shot him in the knee. I like the dressed-up telling of it better. Most stories can be improved by tossing in a few hundred frogs.

 {"Origins":"Much of what makes a car go remains an arcane mystery to the average person. Automobiles are large and complex, and as any car owner quickly discovers, malfunction of even the smallest and most seemingly unimportant automotive part can be all that it takes to render them inoperative.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Tidbits of whispered wisdom therefore prove popular among the less than automotively inclined, who look to keep their vehicles running even if they're not quite sure exactly how to go about that. One bit of whispered wisdom dictates that a car's battery must never be stored on a concrete or cement floor. The reasons given for this prohibition vary depending on whom one hears the admonition from. Acid leaking from the battery will ruin the floor, say some. Or a battery left sitting on such surface will never again properly hold a charge. Or those particular surfaces will cause a battery to lose some of its charge. Oddly, the reality behind this peculiar automotive belief somewhat mirrors the long-standing urban legend about a mysterious and seemingly nonsensical cooking practice handed down through three generations: just as there was once something to Grandma's oddball cooking secret , so too was there a time when storing car batteries on concrete or cement floors was a lousy thing to do. However (and again just like the \"cooking secret\" legend), whereas at one time there was good reason for the practice, those days have long since passed. Car batteries used to be encased in hard rubber, a substance that was porous enough that battery acid could seep through it and create a conductive path through the damp concrete, draining the battery. The cases of today s batteries, however, are made of sturdier stuff that far better contains their contents than those of yesteryear. As well, time has brought technological improvements to the seals around the posts and the vent systems. These days, the problem of car battery electrolyte seepage and migration has been all but eliminated. Says battery manufacturer Yuasa , \"Nowadays, containers are made from a solid plastic that does not allow any current to flow through it, so the batteries do not discharge, even if they sit in a few inches of water.\" Interestingly, some experts (including Car Talk's Click and Clack) believe that storing car batteries on concrete floors might actually be a better idea than keeping them on shelves or other surfaces because the cold of the floor works to slow the self-discharge (leakage) rate.

This image was likely inspired by a December 2015 Washington Post article which reported that Sanders was the only one of 16 presidential candidates (in any party) currently paying his campaign interns: In August, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted an application for unpaid interns, requiring a r sum and two letters of reference. Just a few days later, she was posting about the student debt crisis. On the Republican side, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has called the opportunity gap \"the defining issue of our time,\" and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has railed against \"upward-mobility stagnation.\" Like Clinton, both of them have proposals to reduce student debt. Even retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson wants public universities to pay the interest on student loans, while business mogul Donald Trump has accused the federal government of profiting off students. But of the 16 candidates running for president, only one pays his interns: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at $$10.10 an hour. While it may be generally accurate to say that Bernie Sanders is one of the few (if not the only) 2016 presidential candidate paying his interns, a few exceptions and clarifications that should be noted. First, the candidates offering unpaid internships are not breaking any laws. In most cases, it is perfectly legal to hire interns for non-paying positions as long as those interns receive some tangible benefit (such as school credit or valuable work experience) in return. Second, some candidates, such as Republican Ben Carson, do offer their interns others forms of compensation, such as stipends for food or travel. And neither we nor the Washington Post have been able to determine if GOP candidate Donald Trump's campaigns offers internships (or, if so, whether those internships are paid positions), although we note that interns at Trump Entertainment Resorts are reportedly paid $$10 an hour. The campaign teams of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie have all recently posted advertisements seeking interns for non-paying positions. A recent posting on Bernie Sanders' web site, on the other hand, advertises a paid internship position (although such ads do not necessarily indicate that all campaign internship positions are paying ones): Bernie 2016 is currently looking for a full-time Digital Intern. This position will require working directly with the Digital and Social Media Directors. This is a paid internship based in Washington, D.C. Unpaid internships are quite common in politics. A 2013 study by the Atlantic found that only one-third of U.S. senators paid their interns. That article also criticized Democratic senators for being more stingy in their use of unpaid interns while singling out Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) as an exception to the rule: [E]mbarrassingly, the vast majority of senators who do pay [their interns] are Republicans. Of those 35 senators [who pay their interns], only 11 are Democrats meaning almost 80 percent of Dems require volunteer participation (not counting Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats). This is peculiar and troubling for a party that elsewhere signals its commitment to fair pay, equal representation, economic inequality, and workplace welfare. When it comes to interns in the Senate, it seems that traditional beliefs about labor and economic opportunity are suddenly switched. Although President Obama is not pictured in the above-displayed image (since he is not a candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign), we also note that White House internships provide neither pay nor housing for those who fill such positions.

 {"Origins":"Despite the vital role automobile seat belts have played in saving thousands and thousands of lives over the last several decades, there is still a group of drivers and passengers who are determined not to wear them, for any number of reasons: because they find them too uncomfortable or confining, because they don't believe in their efficacy, because they've heard that wearing seat belts might actually cost them their lives in certain types of accidents, or because they resent as an unwarranted intrusion of government into private life the plethora of laws now requiring motorists to buckle up.","Fact Check":"","Description":"In this vein, we note with a sense of both sadness and irony a couple of articles recently called to our attention. The first is a 17 September 2004 editorial published in the Daily Nebraskan and entitled \"Individual Rights Buckle Under Seat Belt Laws,\" by Derek Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which the writer inveighed against mandatory seat belt laws, opining that \"Uncle Sam is not here to regulate every facet of life no matter the consequences,\" and that \"Democrats and Republicans alike should stand together to stop these laws that are incongruous with the ideals of both parties.\" In the midst of his editorial he noted: As laws become increasingly strict for seat belts, fewer people will respond positively by buckling up in response to the laws. There seems to be a die-hard group of non-wearers out there who simply do not wish to buckle up no matter what the government does. I belong to this group. Evidently his words were far more prescient than any of us might have wanted, as an article in the 4 January 2005 Lincoln Journal Star reported that Mr. Kieper not only died in a car crash, but the tragic mishap that claimed his life was the very type of accident in which seat belts have proved so effective in saving lives by preventing passengers from being ejected from vehicles: Derek Kieper was a smart, funny, intense young man who relished a good debate and would do anything for his friends. Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died early Tuesday morning when the Ford Explorer he was a passenger in traveled off an icy section of Interstate 80 and rolled several times in a ditch. Kieper, who was riding in the back seat of the Explorer, was ejected from the vehicle. Two others in the vehicle, including the driver, Luke Havermann of Ogallala, and the front-seat passenger, Nick Uphoff of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, sustained non-life threatening injuries. Havermann and Uphoff, both 21, were being treated at BryanLGH Medical Center West. Derek, who was thrown from the vehicle, was not wearing a seat belt, [Capt. Joe Lefler of the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office] said. He said Havermann and Uphoff were wearing seat belts at the time. In a similar vein, in July 2011 a helmetless motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars of his motorcycle in Onondaga, New York: Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE). Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law.","Originally

 {"Origins":"Sales pitches for International Driving Permits (IDPs), often misleadingly presented as offering \"International Driver's Licenses,\" are rife with misinformation. In short: International Driving Permits do exist. The people advertising them are not authorized to sell them directly. (They're either peddling unauthorized, look-alike documents or charging customers hefty mark-ups to help them order IDPs from authorized sellers.) An IDP will not help you to avoid paying for traffic tickets, keep points off your driving record, establish a new identity, or get you into bars if you're underage. An IDP does not provide illegal aliens with documented status, nor does it allow foreigners (legal or otherwise) who do not have current, valid driver's licenses from their home countries to drive on U.S. roads. An International Driving Permit is essentially a booklet containing translations of the information found on your \"real\" driver's license into eleven different languages (including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, German, Arabic, Italian, and Portuguese). In accordance with several United Nations conventions on road safety, most U.N. member nations have agreed to recognize and accept IDPs. (Some countries require foreign drivers to have IDPs, some prefer but don't require them, and some don't require them at all.) The IDP is not a license in itself, however it is merely a translation of the current driver's license issued to you by your home country (or state), and it must be used in conjunction with that driver's license. (That is, if you are stopped by law enforcement while driving in another country, they will expect to see both your IDP and your original license.) You cannot obtain an IDP if you do not already hold a valid driver's license .","Fact Check":"","Description":"Moreover, only two organizations are authorized by the State Department to sell IDPs in the United States: the American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance (through the National Automobile Club ). Anyone else who attempts to sell you any type of international driver's license or permit is either peddling worthless imitation documents or is charging you an exorbitant mark-up (typically 100% or more) to simply order the IDP for you from an authorized seller. (An IDP takes but a few minutes to apply for and costs only $$15). Let's go back through the claims in the advertisement reproduced above: Need a new driver's license? As explained above, an IDP is not a \"new\" driver's license. You must already hold a valid driver's license to obtain one, and an IDP is used in conjunction with (not in place of) your existing license. Too many points or other trouble? An IDP will not allow you to avoid points against your driver's license. Any points assessed against you for traffic violations would be applied to your current license. Want a license that can never be suspended or revoked? Your IDP is valid only as long as you hold a valid driver's license; if your license is suspended or revoked, your IDP is no longer good. As well, IDPs are valid for one year only. Want ID for nightclubs or hotel check-in? It's unlikely anyone (in the USA, at least) would accept an IDP as a valid form of identification; in any case, there's no real advantage to it since the IDP contains all the same information as your driver's license. You can't obtain an IDP using a different name from the one on your driver's license, for example, nor can a 16-year-old purchase an IDP that proclaims him to be 21 years old. Avoid tickets, fines, and mandatory driver's education. As noted above, this isn't true. Any tickets or fines assessed against you for traffic violations would be applied to your standard driver's license, not your IDP. Protect your privacy, and hide your identity. Nope, still not true. The IDP contains the same name, address, and other identifying information as your standard driver's license. In general, most U.S. states allow foreign motorists from any of the countries who are party to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic (1949) or the Convention on the Regulation of Inter-American Motor Vehicle Traffic (1943) to drive legally using their valid domestic driver's license while visiting the United States as tourists.

 {"Origins":"In a 1 November 2015 article titled \"318 People Shot in Chicago on Halloween, Obama Declares State of Emergency,\" the web site Celebtricity reported that: More than 300 people were shot and 97 people were killed in shootings throughout the city this Halloween night in Chicago of 2015 in what many are calling the HALLOWEEN PURGE","Fact Check":"","Description":"That s an increase in shootings and gun deaths compared to Halloween of 2014, when 134 people were wounded and 36 were slain in shootings. This October , 446 people in total were slain in Chicago, with 137 dying from gunshot wounds. The story was demonstrably false, and Celebtricity's (hard to find) disclaimer identifies it as a fake news site whose content is for \"entertainment\" only: Celebtricity.com is the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website in the world with the most shocking headlines to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief. Previous Celebtricity news hoaxes included stories about sex dolls being marketed for pedophiles, a claim NBA star Michael Jordan was indifferent to violence sparked by a line of shoes bearing his name, a tall tale about a Wendy's worker who tainted a customer's food with bodily fluids, and a yarn about a couple purportedly arrested for selling real estate on the moon.

 {"Origins":"On 18 September 2015 the humor site The Good Lord Above published an article reporting that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had saved three children and a dog from a house fire, but the U.S. news media had curiously ignored the story: Bernie Sanders is recovering Friday after saving 3 children and a dog from a house that was on fire.","Fact Check":"Did Bernie Sanders save a dog from a burning building in a rescue ignored by the media?","Description":"Local fire officials say the 74-year-old Bernie Sanders, a democratic candidate for president, was on a campaign march through town when he noticed smoke coming from a house down the block. Once he was sure the kids were safe, officials say Sanders entered the burning home again to rescue the family dog. Despite the incredibly heroic actions of Bernie Sanders, the news media has completely ignored this story because it would go against the wishes of their corporate masters. Details in the article hinted at The Good Lord Above's satirical intent: the fire's cause was attributed to a child attempting to cook because both parents were working, and a home insurance policy purportedly wouldn't compensate the family because they were \"too poor.\" (Two strong positions held by Sanders are support for workers' rights and broad condemnation of corporate abuses.) Moreover, the reason provided for the story's absence from the news was the objection of \"corporate masters\" whom readers are meant to infer stand in opposition of Sanders' candidacy. Unlike most \"fake news\" sites, The Good Lord Above's scope largely spans obviously satirical content supposedly written from God's perspective. Prior articles include \"After 2000 Years of Silence, God Launches New Website,\" \"GOD: I'm finally off drugs and it feels good,\" and \"Trump Calls Jesus 'A Loser.'\" While the web site does not include a readily available disclaimer, the site's Facebook page makes it clear that all articles published on The Good Lord Above are humorous in nature: God made the world. Then he flooded it. Then God went to sleep for about 2000 years. Anyway, eventually God woke up and felt pretty bad for what he'd done in the past. In 2011, after years of therapy, God started this Holy and Divine God Facebook Page to restore his good name.

 {"Origins":"As unbelievable as such stories must sound, babies have been left on the roofs of cars that were subsequently driven away. Such accidents of forgetfulness happen with surprising regularity, and it doesn't take all that diligent a search through old newspapers to dig up news reports documenting one such incident after another: In May 1992, three-month-old Matthew Murray of Worcester, MA, was left strapped in his baby seat on top of his dad's Hyundai. The vehicle got up to speeds of 50 mph on Interstate 290 before the seat slid off the roof, landing the baby (miraculously uninjured) on the busy highway. In December 1997, two-month-old Marcus Abram of the Chicago area was placed in his car seat on the roof of his mom's car while she moved things around inside to make room for two more passengers she was picking up. The child, still strapped to the car seat, fell off the roof of the car into a busy intersection with cars whizzing by in all directions. A passing trucker noticed the baby seat, stopped, and rescued the injured infant. The child fortunately suffered nothing more serious than lacerations to the face and head. In July 1980, six-week-old Brian Kornbach was left in his infant seat on top of the family car while the adults switched places in the front seat. The child was found by a roadside in Queens by a passerby who took the injured infant to the hospital. His parents did not notice they'd failed to bring their son in off the roof until they were somewhere in the Bronx. The above are just a few of the many instances of babies being left on car tops. It's not meant to be a comprehensive list, just a representative one to provide a better idea of how often this happens. Folklorist Jan Brunvand collected information on fourteen such incidents that had taken place between 1975 and 1993.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Some of the real-life babies who went flying off car roofs and into roadside ditches were injured by the experience. In lore, that never happens either the tot is rescued from the roof of the speeding car by a vigilant policeman, or is afterwards found by the side of the road, shaken yet unharmed. For once, lore is less brutal than reality. Barbara \"bouncing babies\" Mikkelson Sightings: Look for this tale in the 1987 film Raising Arizona and a 1990 episode of TV's Married With Children .","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093822;","Example":"Did you hear about this couple driving through Southern Utah? They were on their way to California, and they went to change drivers and the wife took the baby out of the car and put him on the roof of the car. Then they both switched sides and got back into the car. She just assumed that the husband had put the baby back in, but he hadn't even seen it. They drove off, and the baby slid off, but he was OK because he was in a plastic infant seat. About two hours later they realized that they forgot the baby. So they drove back, and someone had stopped for the baby, and the baby was OK. Variations: The situation which prompts the child to be left on the roof varies: It's a long drive and time to change drivers. The baby is placed on the roof while groceries are loaded into the car. When the car has a flat, everything has to be shifted about to get to the tire jack.","Last Updated":"7 April 2011","Credibility":-1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/mishaps/babyroof.asp","Claim":"A baby

 {"Origins":"On 1 March 2012, Seattle-based venture capitalist and entrepreneur Nick Hanauer participated in the global conference series of \"TED Talks.\" The video of his six-minute talk, widely circulated since its release, captured him addressing a spate of issues pertaining to income inequality and capitalism from the perspective of a very wealthy individual: Not long after Hanauer's March 2012 talk was filmed, rumors began circulating claiming that TED had deliberately suppressed the clip due to its potentially offensive (to rich people) nature. On 16 May 2012, National Journal published an article contending that TED's organizers had quashed the groundbreaking talk because its content was simply too controversial to release, an odd assertion considering the 2011 emergence of a well-known (and widely reported upon) protest movement known as Occupy Wall Street):","Fact Check":"Was Nick Hanauer's 2012 TED Talk about income inequality banned because it was \"too politically controversial\" to release?","Description":"TED organizers invited a multimillionaire Seattle venture capitalist named Nick Hanauer the first nonfamily investor in Amazon.com to give a speech on March 1 at their TED University conference. Inequality was the topic specifically, Hanauer's contention that the middle class, and not wealthy innovators like himself, are America's true \"job creators.\" \"We've had it backward for the last 30 years,\" he said. \"Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs. Rather they are a consequence of an ecosystemic feedback loop animated by middle-class consumers, and when they thrive, businesses grow and hire, and owners profit. That's why taxing the rich to pay for investments that benefit all is a great deal for both the middle class and the rich.\" You can't find that speech online. TED officials told Hanauer initially they were eager to distribute it. \"I want to put this talk out into the world!\" one of them wrote him in an e-mail in late April. But early this month they changed course, telling Hanauer that his remarks were too \"political\" and too controversial for posting. In the years since 2012, Hanauer's TED clip has paradoxically been viewed millions of times while remaining the focus of articles describing it as described as \"banned,\" \"too controversial,\" or the speech TED \"doesn't want you to see.\" While it's difficult to determine the accuracy of statements about its online availability in March 2012, the clip clearly became widely available and was frequently viewed on sharing sites such as YouTube shortly thereafter, and it has remained popular ever since. But in 2015, many social media users continued to assert Hanauer's talk was banned: Banned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer Rich People Don t Create Jobs (VIDEO) #news http://t.co/wmlAmaIZ48 Hannah Kennison (@HannahKennison1) July 6, 2015 Nick Hanauer on His Banned TED Talk & Why the Middle Class are the Job Creators http://t.co/KKQOqIK5PQ Jonathan Goodman (@GoodmanJonathan) July 20, 2015 if you are interested in #economics, then it is worth listening Banned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer 'Rich people don't... http://t.co/00E6rlPF1g Mudassar Bashir (@mb62020) June 15, 2015 Nick Hanauer too politically controversial : rich people don t create jobs, consumers do - via Reese Jones http://t.co/9xzs0vn1kz V rit TV (@Verite_TV) June 11, 2015 In late May 2012 a contributor to TED's forums specifically asked why Hanauer's talk had been \"banned,\" prompting a lengthy discussion during the course of which individuals affiliated with TED linked to a statement issued by TED curator Chris Anderson on why Hanauer's talk had not been promoted. The service by which Anderson published the explanation (Posterous) shuttered in April 2013, taking Anderson's remarks with it. However, a cached version revealed the date (17 May 2012), title (\"TED and inequality: The real story\"), and content of Anderson's rebuttal. Anderson opened by stating that \"TED was subject to a story so misleading it would be funny... except it successfully launched an aggressive online campaign against us.\" He described an ensuing \"firestorm of outrage\" on sites including Reddit and Huffington Post, wherein TED was \"accused of being cowards ... in the pay of our corporate partners ... [and] the despicable puppets of the Republican party.\" Anderson's account of the decision not to release Hanauer's talk differed dramatically from the circulating rumors: Here's what actually happened. At TED this year, an attendee pitched a 3-minute audience talk on inequality. The talk tapped into a really important and timely issue. But it framed the issue in a way that was explicitly partisan. (The talk is explicitly attacking what he calls an article of faith for Republicans. He criticizes Democrats too, but only for not also attacking this idea more often.) And it included a number of arguments that were unconvincing, even to those of us who supported his overall stance, such as the apparent ruling out of entrepreneurial initiative as a root cause of job creation. The audience at TED who heard it live (and who are often accused of being overly enthusiastic about left-leaning ideas) gave it, on average, mediocre ratings some enthusiastic, others critical. At TED we post one talk a day on our home page. We're drawing from a pool of 250+ that we record at our own conferences each year and up to 10,000 recorded at the various TEDx events around the world, not to mention our other conference partners. Our policy is to post only talks that are truly special. And we try to steer clear of talks that are bound to descend into the same dismal partisan head-butting people can find every day elsewhere in the media. We discussed internally and ultimately told the speaker we did not plan to post. He did not react well. He had hired a PR firm to promote the talk to MoveOn and others, and the PR firm warned us that unless we posted he would go to the press and accuse us of censoring him. We again declined and this time I wrote him and tried gently to explain in detail why I thought his talk was flawed. So he forwarded portions of the private emails to a reporter and the National Journal duly bit on the story. And it was picked up by various other outlets. As Anderson noted, income inequality was the subject of at least one [uncensored] TED Talk video in 2011. Much of the rumor regarding Nick Hanauer's purportedly banned TED Talk segment hinged upon the differing assertions made by TED and Nick Hanauer at the time of the controversy in 2012. However, Anderson's claims (that TED curators are tasked with promoting only the most impactful clips) weren't implausible or suggestive of a coverup. It would be difficult to determine whether Hanauer or anyone working on his behalf threatened a public relations offensive, but TED maintained that quality and not content was behind the decision not to feature the video (which clearly was not \"banned\" from public view but was simply not promoted by TED). Since the time of the initial debate over whether or why the TED talk was \"banned,\" the clip has been distributed both by TED and other outlets and widely viewed by a large online audience. In August 2014, Hanauer returned for a TED Talk titled \"Beware, fellow plutocrats, the pitchforks are coming.\" While it's true that TED opted not to promote Hanauer's initial appearance (during which he discussed income inequality) his segment was not banned, and the organization cited his lack of substantive content alongside his primary reliance on partisan ideas as the reason it was not curated alongside other featured TED Talks. At no point during the immediate controversy did TED appear to deny the existence of the video, remove it from the Internet, interfere with its distribution, or otherwise thwart the ideas advocated by Hanauer from spreading. The group simply chose initially not to promote the clip (as they doe for a large number of TED Talks) in favor of other content selected by their curators.

 {"Origins":"On 29 August 2015, a Tumblr user re-blogged a \"note\" about Adolf Hitler and World War II (originally shared by another user), appendeding a claim about the parents of former Vermont senator (and Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders' parents being Holocaust survivors: \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932.","Fact Check":"Were Bernie Sanders' parents Holocaust survivors?","Description":"He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including 6 million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\" Bernie Sanders parents are Holocaust survivors by the way. Both posts (which between them accumulated a quarter of a million comments) linked to an 11 June 2015 Christian Science Monitor article that focused on then-current online rumor claiming that Sanders maintained dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. In that article, Sanders mentioned that his father had emigrated from Poland but did not describe his parents as Holocaust survivors: Chances are, Sanders's religion would not have come up at the Monitor breakfast, except for a controversy the day before. During an interview broadcast by NPR, host Diane Rehm had asserted, mistakenly, that Sanders was a dual US-Israeli citizen. He immediately corrected her, calling it \"nonsense that goes on in the Internet.\" But Ms. Rehm pressed on and asked about other members of Congress. Sanders took offense. \"I honestly don't know but I have read that on the Internet. You know, my dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. He loved this country. I am, you know, I got offended a little bit by that comment, and I know it's been on the Internet. I am obviously an American citizen, and I do not have any dual citizenship.\" Similarly, a 21 January 2007 New York Times magazine article on Sanders reported that Sanders' father Eli came from Poland and \"saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust,\" but did not state that Eli Sanders himself was a Holocaust survivor: Sanders's parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father, Eli, a struggling paint salesman who saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust, worried constantly about supporting his wife and two sons. His mother, Dorothy, dreamed of living in a \"private home,\" but they never made it beyond their three-and-a-half-room apartment on East 26th and Kings Highway. She died at age 46, when Bernie was 19. \"Sensitivity to class was imbedded in me then quite deeply,\" Sanders told me. On 25 July 2015, the Sanders for President campaign released a five-minute long video spot titled \"Progress,\" in which (at the 30-second mark) Sanders briefly stated that his mother was born in New York (not Poland) and had died young: Tablet magazine published an in-depth piece on Sanders on 20 August 2015 that provided additional detail about Sanders' parents, reporting that Eli Sanders' immigrated to the U.S. in 1921, well before the outbreak of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust (although a number of Eli Sanders' relatives who remained in Poland perished in concentration camps years later): Bernie Sanders is a typical American Jew of his generation in that his story doesn't hew to any preconceived narratives or stereotypes, except for the fact that it begins in Brooklyn, where he and his brother Larry grew up in a modest apartment located off Kings Highway. Like many Brooklyn families, the Sanderses aspired to become middle-class Americans while living in the shadow of the Holocaust. In 1921, Larry and Bernie s father, Eli, left his family in Slopnice, a rural village in the South of Poland, and immigrated to the United States. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Slopnice's wide-open fields were used for airdrops before the businesses and goods of the town's local Jews were closed and confiscated. Most of Eli's family was sent to concentration camps where they were killed. \"Politics was not an aside [for us],\" Larry Sanders has said. \"It was life or death.\" In late May 2015, Bernie Sanders covered the same biographic ground during a speech in Burlington, Vermont: My father came to this country from Poland without a penny in his pocket and without much of an education. My mother graduated high school in New York City. My father worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we were solidly lower-middle class. My parents, brother and I lived in a small rent-controlled apartment. My mother s dream was to move out of that small apartment into a home of our own. She died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. As a kid I learned, in many, many ways, every day, what lack of money means to a family, and that is a lesson I have never forgotten and never will. So while Bernie Sanders' father, Eli Sanders, immigrated to the United States from Poland, he did so back in 1921 thus could not accurately be described as a Holocaust survivor under even the broadest definitions of the term. Sanders' mother, Dorothy Sanders, was born in New York City and thus was neither an immigrant nor a potential victim of Nazi death camps.

 {"Origins":"On 29 September 2015, the entertainment web site Link Beef published an article claiming reporting that comedian/actor Adam Sandler had been found dead of an apparent suicide at age 49: US actor and comedian Adam Sandler has been found dead, aged 49, in an apparent suicide.","Fact Check":"Was actor Adam Sandler found dead of an apparent suicide at age 49?","Description":"Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time. At this time, the Sheriff s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made, police said in a statement. In a statement, Adam s wife, Jackie Sandler, said she was utterly heartbroken and asked that he be remembered for the joy he brought to the world. This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken, she said. There is no truth to the above-quoted story. Link Beef is one of many fake news web sites that publishes fictitious stories, such as ones about a gang member gold plating his genitals and another about a a lab-grown baby.

Is it true? Origin:On 2 January 2015, the entertainment web site Viral Time Lapse posted an item reporting that comedian Bill Cosby had killed himself in reaction to the news that criminal sexual assault charges had been brought against him: Actor and comedian Bill Cosby, who has recently been charged with sexual assault, was found dead this morning of an apparent suicide in his Philadelphia, Pennsylvania home. He was 78. His death has been reported as \"a suicide due to asphyxia.\" Philadelphia police confirmed that Cosby committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope. Cosby was discovered by his wife and left no suicide note. \"Bill Cosby passed away this morning,\" his reps said in a statement. \"He has been battling sexual assault accusations of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.\" There was no truth to this story, as Viral Time Lapse is a \"satire\" (i.e., fake news) site that does not publish factual stories. A disclaimer on Viral Time Lapse notes that the site's articles are \"entirely fictional\": Viral Time Lapse shall not be responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by website users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in this website or by any technical or human error which may occur. Viral Time Lapse assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. Bill Cosby was indeed charged with sexual assault (although as of 4 January 2016 the comedian was still among the living). According to a CNN report, Cosby posted $$1 million bail, and Cosby's attorney asserted that his client would fight the charges: Hours after Bill Cosby set foot in a Pennsylvania courtroom to face sexual assault charges, the comedian's attorneys called the criminal case against him \"unjustified\" and vowed to fight it. \"The charge by the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office came as no surprise, filed 12 years after the alleged incident and coming on the heels of a hotly contested election for this county's DA during which this case was made the focal point,\" Cosby's attorneys said in a statement released after his arraignment Wednesday. \"Make no mistake, we intend to mount a vigorous defense against this unjustified charge and we expect that Mr. Cosby will be exonerated by a court of law.\" Several rumors have circulated in the wake of Cosby's indictment, including the false claim that the comedian's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame had been removed.

 {"Origins":"Allowing motorists to obtain personalized plates provides them with an opportunity to obtain something distinctively unique, something that commands far more attention than the usual humdrum string of letters and digits. Sometimes, though, one's choice of license plate can command an unexpected and undesirable form of attention.","Fact Check":"","Description":"In 1979 a Los Angeles man named Robert Barbour found this out the hard way when he sent an application to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) requesting personalized license plates for his car. The DMV form asked applicants to list three choices in case one or two of their desired selections had already been assigned. Barbour, a sailing enthusiast, wrote down \"SAILING\" and \"BOATING\" as his first two choices; when he couldn't think of a third option, he wrote \"NO PLATE,\" meaning that if neither of his two choices was available, he did not want personalized plates. Plates reading \"BOATING\" and \"SAILING\" had indeed already been assigned, so the DMV, following Barbour's instructions literally, sent him license plates reading \"NO PLATE.\" Barbour was not thrilled that the DMV had misunderstood his intent, but he opted to keep the plates because of their uniqueness. Four weeks later he received his first notice for an overdue parking fine, from faraway San Francisco, andwithin days he began receiving dozens of overdue notices from all over the state on a daily basis. Why? Because when law enforcement officers ticketed illegally parked cars that bore no license plates, they had been writing \"NO PLATE\" in the license plate field. Now that Barbour had plates bearing that phrase, the DMV computers were matching every unpaid citation issued to a car with missing plates to him. Barbour received about 2,500 notices over the next several months. He alerted the DMV to the problem, and they responded in a typically bureaucratic way by instructing him to change his license plates. But Barbour had grown too fond of his plates by then to want to change them, so he instead began mailing out a form letter in response to each citation. That method usually worked, although occasionally he had to appear before a judge and demonstrate that the car described on the citation was not his. A couple of years later, the DMV finally caught on and sent a notice to law enforcement agencies requesting that they use the word NONE rather than NO PLATE to indicate a cited vehicle was missing its plates. This change slowed the flow of overdue notices Barbour received to a trickle, about five or six a month, but it also had an unintended side effect: Officers sometimes wrote MISSING instead of NONE to indicate cars with missing license plates, and suddenly a man named Andrew Burg in Marina del Rey started receiving parking tickets from places he hadn't visited either. Burg, of course, was the owner of a car with personalized plates reading \"MISSING.\" Nonetheless, some motorists still choose personalized plates destined to land them in similar trouble. Jim Cara of Elsmere, Delaware, found that out the hard way when he selected the phrase \"NOTAG\" for the license of his Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle in 2004: Jim Cara wanted a vanity license tag that would make people laugh. But when he chose \"NOTAG\" for the plate on his Suzuki Hayabusa, a sleek blue and silver motorcycle with a speedometer that reaches 220 mph, the joke backfired. The new tag arrived Saturday under an avalanche of Wilmington parking violations. \"All the traffic tickets say, 'Notice of violation. License number: no tag,'\" Cara said. City computers, talking to state Division of Motor Vehicles computers, had finally found an address for ticketed vehicles that lacked license tags: Cara's home in Elsmere. \"I messed up the system so bad,\" Cara said. \"I wonder if they can put me in jail or something?\" He has received more than 200 violation notices. The mail carrier came twice on Saturday. Cara opened a few. They ranged from $$55 to $$125 for violations such as meter expirations. Cara, 43, who works for the American Motorcycle Association, said he's been a lifelong prankster. This time, though, \"the cleanup is going to be worse than the joke,\" he said. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Harvey collected a few more similar tales from readers in August 2004: \"A few days ago, you printed a bit about people getting notices of unpaid parking tickets on vehicles with license plates NOTAG and NO PLATE,\" wrote Richard Turner of Beverly Hills. He recalled thinking, \"It would be cute to have VOID as my license plate. It was cute for a few years, until I started getting the unpaid parking ticket notices. Apparently, 'void' tickets got keyed into computers as valid tickets, but with my plate. Although I got all the tickets dismissed, I ditched the plates.\" And Ralph August of Westchester says a friend encountered the same barrage of strangers' parking tickets after he put an UNKNOWN plate on his car. The DMV took UNKNOWN away from him. In October 2009, the Birmingham News reported on Hunstville, Alabama, resident Scottie Roberson, who in homage to his nickname (\"Racer X\") and his favorite number (seven) had obtained personalized plates bearing a string of seven X's: 'XXXXXXX.' Suddenly, within a year's time, Roberson received multiple mailed notices of parking violations, totaling more than $$19,000 in fines, from the city of Birmingham even though he had taken his car to that city on only a single occasion in the previous five years. The culprit was his license plate: About a year ago, Roberson began receiving letters stating he had outstanding parking tickets, sometimes as many as 10 in one day in 10 places, he said. Roberson said he has been to Birmingham only once in the past five years and left without a ticket. He said city officials told him the tickets were issued by mistake because of his vanity plate XXXXXXX. When Birmingham parking patrols find cars without license plates parked illegally or at expired meters, they enter seven X's in place of the plate number, city officials said. The parking citation form calls for a plate number, and the practice is to use X's when no number is available.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"13 February 2015","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp","Claim":"A man whose car bore personalized license plates reading 'NO PLATE' received notices for thousands of unpaid parking tickets.","Tags":"","Prob Model":1,"Claim_ID":"autos_law_noplate","Google Results":[{"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.snopes.com","link":"http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"articles.latimes.com","link":"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/02/local/me-only2","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"spydersden.wordpress.com","link":"https://spydersden.wordpress.com/2012/04/page/8/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.metafilter.com","link":"http://www.metafilter.com/34543/No-Plate","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"forums.somethingawful.com","link":"http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3622681","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"forum.ebaumsworld.com","link":"http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/archive/index.php/t-107091.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.freerepublic.com","link":"http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/vanityplates/index","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.freerepublic.com","link":"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1178986/posts","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"growabrain.typepad.com","link":"http://growabrain.typepad.com/growabrain/cars_license_plates/page/2/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"mlsallpf.tripod.com","link":"http://mlsallpf.tripod.com/ncf/no-ticket-for-no-lihh.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"xapo90kmk.20fr.com","link":"http://xapo90kmk.20fr.com/19702q/licen1248.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"freerepublic.com","link":"http://freerepublic.com/tag/thisaintnews/index","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"growabrain.typepad.com","link":"http://growabrain.typepad.com/growabrain/2004/07/page/2/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"italychronicles.com","link":"http://italychronicles.com/speeding-fines-in-italy/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"link.springer.com","link":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00283-010-9170-7.pdf","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"tvtropes.org","link":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityLicensePlate","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"wikitravel.org","link":"http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.vanityfair.com","link":"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/naples-mob-paolo-di-lauro-italy","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"akdart.com","link":"http://akdart.com/cops.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"exiledonline.com","link":"http://exiledonline.com/tax-the-poor-californias-evil-financing-strategy/all/1","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.encyclopedia.com","link":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sweden.aspx","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"newsinteractive.post-gazette.com","link":"http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/prohibition/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"law.justia.com","link":"http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/7/186.html","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com","link":"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/storm-aftermath-live-updates-5/","link_type":"results"}}, {"results" : {"claim_id":"autos_law_noplate","domain":"www.thebeijinger.com","link":"http://www.thebeijinger.com/forum/2012/05/11/motorcycles-beijing-fact-versus-fiction","link_type":"results"}}]},

 {"Origins":"In November 2015, a conspiracy theory essay positing that Donald Trump would be assassinated before he might become President began circulating via email and online message boards. Most iterations of the essay were titled \"An Interesting Take On Trump,\" \"DONALD TRUMP: WHAT THEY ALL FEAR MOST!\" or \" \"What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency\" and attributed to conservative commentator Bill Bennett: They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.","Fact Check":"","Description":"It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one. It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before. Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations ... like Big Pharma or Big Oil. The above-quoted essay was not written by Bill Bennett. It was originally posted on the web site Reality News Media on 17 September 2015 and circulated for several weeks with no attribution attached to it. It wasn't until mid-November 2015 that Bill Bennett's named started to appear alongside the title in an apparent attempt to lend credibility to the essay. Bennett's views on Donald Trump are not in line with those expressed in the essay. While the unknown author writes that Trump would make a good President since he is self-funded and does not play by the rules, Bennett said in an interview with Sean Hannity that he was not okay with a Trump presidency: Because I look at a man and the totality of his acts and his record and the things he has and stood for. And I think, probably, he's not very principled in terms of his convictions anyway, except he, you know, is a businessman who does things his way, his own idiosyncratic way. I do understand the appeal. People are angry, mad. And he seems big enough to kind of encompass that anger ... ... Here's Trump with a record, you know, longer than your arm, wrong on all these things, getting all this support. That's what makes me a little angry and makes me think there's a lot of irrationality on it... ... Look, if Trump's the nominee, Sean, I will support him because I won't support Hillary.

 {"Origins":"On 11 September 2015, a petition was started on the web site Change.org, ostensibly by (and on behalf of) Muslims, requesting that the city of Munich, Germany, cancel its upcoming Oktoberfest celebration because the event is \"anti-Islamic\": Dear City council of Munich,","Fact Check":"Are Muslim refugees demanding that the city of Munich, Germany, ban Oktoberfest?","Description":"I am writing this letter to bring to your attention something that I and many Muslims believe is unfair and requires attention. I would like to inform you that the Oktoberfest is an Intolerant and Anti-Islamic event. We tried to ignore the event, but there too many Un-Islamic acts done at the Oktoberfest. Such as alcohol consumption, public nudity etc. We understand that the Oktoberfest is a yearly German tradition, but we, Muslims, can not tolerate this Un-Islamic event, because it offends us and all Muslims on the earth. We are requesting the immediate cancellation of the upcoming Oktoberfest event. We also believe that the Oktoberfest might also offend all the Muslim refugees coming from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. The cancellation of the Oktoberfest event will help refugees not to forget their Islamic history. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Morad Almuradi While the petition was \"real\" in the sense that someone actually posted it to Change.org, it was not written by \"Muslim refugees\" in Germany as implied by some publications. The author of the petition, Morad Almuradi, listed his location as The Netherlands: The intentions of the author were also unclear, but even if the petition were written in earnest, it would represent one person's opinion and not that of all Muslim refugees. Additionally, the viewpoint expressed by the petition appears to be a minority opinion, as the petition has only managed to muster a few hundred signatures, and the majority of those appear to have come from people who signed in order to add hateful comments: Those comments lead us to believe that this petition may was created by an Internet troll in order to foment outrage. The fact that this petition was posted on 11 September, a day on which items critical of Islam tend to reach fever pitch, supports this hypothesis. It should also be noted that anyone can start a petition on Change.org for any reason. The web site is currently hosting petitions asking Beyonce to make another Destiny's Child album, for President Obama to allow a high school student to have a party after homecoming, and for WaWa to bring back roast beef sandwiches. Just because something appears on Change.org doesn't mean that it was written in earnest, that it represents a majority opinion, or that it should be taken seriously.

 {"Origins":"In 1972, the alternative newspaper Vermont Freeman published an essay by Bernie Sanders entitled \"Man and Woman\" in which the future U.S. senator included a reference to a woman fantasizing about rape. After Sanders gained political prominence as a presidential candidate in 2015, that essay was brought to wider attention in a profile of Sanders published by Mother Jones on 26 May 2015: What Sanders did share with the young radicals and hippies flocking to Vermont was a smoldering idealism forged during his college years as a civil rights activist he coordinated a sit-in against segregated housing and attended the 1963 March on Washington but only a fuzzy sense of how to act on it. Sanders bounced back and forth between Vermont and New York City, where he worked at a psychiatric hospital. After his marriage broke up in the late 1960s, he moved to an A-frame farmhouse outside the Vermont town of Stannard, a tiny hamlet with no paved roads in the buckle of the commune belt. He dabbled in carpentry and tried to get by as a freelance journalist for alternative newspapers and regional publications, contributing interviews, political screeds, and, one time, a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics:","Fact Check":"Did Bernie Sanders write an essay in which a woman fantasizes about being \"raped by three men simultaneously\"?","Description":"That essay sparked a debate about Sanders and his views on women, and conservative outlets such as Young Cons, reproduced a portion of the essay in an attempt to illustrate how it was hypocritical for liberals to demonize Republicans for waging a \"War on Women\" when Sanders had written about a rape fantasy in a 1972 essay: According to liberals with IQs smaller than their sock size, conservative presidential candidates absolutely LOATHE women, hate them with a passion even. Those mean, old, white guys which is a hilarious stereotype given there's latinos, blacks, and women in the top spots for the GOP want nothing more than to destroy women s health care by defunding the ghoulish Planned Parenthood, and encourage rape culture with their antiquated views on gender roles. None of this is actually true, of course, but when have facts ever got in the way of the liberal agenda? What should really make you scratch your head is how lefties will rake conservatives over the coals for the things mentioned above, yet say absolutely nothing about this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote: But of course, plenty of publications on both sides of the political spectrum have said a good deal about \"this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote.\" NPR, for example, reported that: The essay by the Vermont senator isn't long only a page. The bit about rape comes at the very beginning, as does some not-totally-safe-for-work language: A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously. The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday and go to Church, or maybe to their 'revolutionary' political meeting. Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Hero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like 'Girl 12 raped by 14 men' sell so well? To what in us are they appealing? Sanders Sanders then goes on to explain his ideas about gender roles and eventually gets at a sharper point that traditional gender roles help create troubling dynamics in men's and women's sex lives. \"Many women seem to be walking a tightrope,\" he writes, as their \"qualities of love, openness, and gentleness were too deeply enmeshed with qualities of dependency, subservience, and masochism.\" One way to read the essay is that Sanders was doing (in a supremely ham-handed way) what journalists do every day: draw the reader in with an attention-getting lede, then get to the meat of the article in the middle. You can draw divergent conclusions from the article itself. On the one hand, he's talking about liberating people from harmful gender norms. On the other, with his nameless hypothetical \"man-and-woman\" characters, he also seems to imply that men fantasize about raping women or that women fantasize about being raped. CNN also covered the controversial essay in a piece that quoted Sanders' campaign spokesman describing it as \"stupid\" and a \"dumb attempt at dark satire\": Michael Briggs, Sanders' campaign spokesman, said the article was a \"dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication\" that \"in no way reflects his views or record on women. It was intended to attack gender stereotypes of the '70s, but it looks as stupid today as it was then.\" Last updated: 22 September 2015","Originally Published":" 22 September 2015","Referred Links":"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/index.html;http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained;http://www.youngcons.com/this-bernie-sanders-quote-about-rape-should-horrify-women-everywhere/;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/young-bernie-sanders-liberty-union-vermont;","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, September 2015] This quote about rape has been attributed to Bernie Sanders.

 {"Origins":"On 22 November 2015, the Facebook page New Yorkers posted a photo purportedly showing a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City:","Fact Check":"","Description":"41 pound rat recently caught in NYC... (via Chris Brannigan) While the above-displayed image has been shared by various outlets, no one has been able to provide any substantial information about the enormous rodent. If this rat truly was \"caught\" in New York City, it is most likely a brown rat, or Norway rat. The city has approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these animals can only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs in weight. But as many commenters pointed out on The New Yorker's post, the animal doesn't look like it was caught at all. The rat looks groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone's pet. If that's the case, the above-pictured animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these animals are larger than the brown rat, they don't typically get any bigger than four pounds. So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It's likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (you'll notice that their hands cannot be seen in the photo) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. While this makes the rat appear larger in the photo, the animal pictured is just an average sized rat. For comparison's sake, here's a photo of a 3 foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012: In summation, the above-displayed photo does not show a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City. While we can't determine the exact dimensions of the above-pictured animal, it was likely someone's pet and weighed no more than four pounds.

 {"Origins":"Of all the crazy Internet stories, this has to be the one fellas love the most. There's something about cars and solid rocket fuel engines that draws them to this tale like happy moths to an unforgiving flame. Maybe it's the Wile E. Coyote-ness of it all, the \"so real you can almost touch it\" mental image of a smoldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face. Perhaps it's the vicarious enjoyment of a Tim Allen-ish \"More Power!\" fantasy carried to its fatal yet hilarious conclusion. Or maybe it's a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Whatever. The boys love it, and that's all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine? The story is even older than that. One of our readers says he heard it in 1961 or 1962. In that version, two JATO units mounted as \"lakers\" (exhaust pipes) on a 1940 Ford were fired on Bayshore freeway while trying to outrun the California Highway Patrol. The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In that version, the unmanned JATO'd car went airborne and smashed into a tree, destroying both car and plant. The version we now know and love (complete with puzzled police and the smoldering wreck of what's left of a car impacted into the face of a cliff), began making the cyberspatial rounds in 1990. In 1992 the incident was said to have happened in New Mexico, with the car being a Plymouth Road Runner. By 1994 the car had transformed itself into a Chevrolet Impala, but now the accident's venue was California. (See how these things mutate over time?) 1995 saw this legend just about take over the Internet as it was flashed from e-mail to e-mail as \"this year's Darwin Award winner.\" It's this version which is still in circulation today, the car frozen in time as a Chevy Impala, the location given as somewhere in Arizona. As it appeared in 1995: \"Darwin award\" Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards it's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year's nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push' for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve ... The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY'S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don't have an 'off' switch . . . Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn't true though they continued to get asked about it. \"We get a call on that about every 90 days,'' said Dave Myers. ''It keeps us on the map.'' There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they've both heard the story and no, it's not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car's brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph.

It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver's remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.","Last Updated":"12 November 2006","Credibility":-1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp","Claim":"The remains of a smoldering JATO-equipped

 {"Origins":"On 14 July 2015, the web site Newswatch33 published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 15 Days of Complete Darkness in November 2015,\" claiming: NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2015. The event, according to NASA, hasn't occurred in over 1 Million years.","Fact Check":"Has NASA confirmed that there will be 15 straight days of darkness in November 2015?","Description":"Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2015 at 3 a.m. and will end on Monday, November 30, 2015 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the \"November Black Out\" event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter. Charles Bolden, who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama, issued a 1000 page document explaining the event to the White House. While Charles Bolden is a real NASA official, the Newswatch33 web site is not a legitimate news outlet. Newswatch33 is a fake news site began darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015. Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" yarn was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that has been around the online block several times before. Newswatch33 has hoaxed social media users a number of times since its inception, falsely claiming that supporters raised $$4 million for the defense of Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof, that a girl was electrocuted by her iPhone's earbuds, that Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased the rights to the Confederate flag, and that the federal government had impregnated inexpensive cigars with listening devices. In October 2015, the fake news web site Huzlers published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!\"; that article essentially repackaged the original fabrication. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included a claim that semen was found in Starbucks drinks nationwide, that McDonald's was busted using \"human meat,\" that Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their meals, and that an Ebola victim rose from the dead as a zombie.

 {"Origins":"A bizarre theory claiming that singer Avril Lavigne died and was replaced with a doppelg nger has been circulating online since the idea was first offered by the Portuguese-language blog \"Avril Esta Morta\" (Avril Is Dead) back in 2012. Since then, a ridiculous amount of \"evidence\" has surfaced to prove that the person currently posing as Avril Lavigne is an impostor. Song lyrics were analyzed, photographs were examined, and soon the conspiracy theory was propagated by web sites such as God Like Productions:","Fact Check":"","Description":"Too bad I can't post the link here because it certainly will get me banned LOL, but it's a VERY VERY well built website, probably made by a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne, and the author of the article scrutinized several details of her career to came to a conclusion that the Canadian singer hanged herself before the second album and was replaced by a doppelganger, who left several clues about the death of the original Avril, in the lyrics and covers of the next albums. Some lyrics are pretty blatant by the way! I quoted the verses that highlight a possible suicide! According to the article's author, she killed herself after she went home and found out that her parents abandoned her. Nobody's Home: Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside. Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,oh The elaborate theory was even broken down by popular publications such as Vice and Gawker, and soon fans of the singer started questioning whether or not she was alive. But in July 2015 the \"Avril Esta Morta\" blog admitted that the theory was a completely fabricated one: Avril is not dead... The blog was a way to show how conspiracy theories can seem real. Many people believe everything they see on the internet, but is it right? There are many conspiracy theories about many things, but some seem no more convincing than theories that are not real. Avril Lavigne never died and was replaced by a lookalike, I created this theory to see if people would believe it, and thousands of people believed it was a fact. An important point is that I created this theory with no intention of lying; all I did is offer arguments that anyone could search for information about and prove. I used information to form a real theory that is in fact unreal. I apologize to people who believed that she was dead and feel disappointed about this revelation, but this was an exercise to teach to become more skeptical cand not believe everything you see! It was never my intention to offend anyone, just to create a theory and test people's reaction to it. You will observe I left some clues that it was all just a theory and not a fact, for example when in the beginning of the blog I referenced the \"supposed death of the singer Avril Lavigne.\" In other words, it is just a guess! If you want to believe that she is dead, that is your choice, but I say that it was all just a theory created by me. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The above-quoted update was only \"liked\" 500 times within six months of its original publication. The Vice article, on the other hand, has been shared tens of thousands of times. As such, a number of Avril Lavigne's fans still believe that she passed away and was replaced with a doppelg nger: I watched a creepy conspiracy video last night about how Avril Lavigne is actually dead and I'm still freaked out jacey (@jacerain) November 5, 2015 I kinda believe avril lavigne is really dead santa baby (@shaghennessy) November 5, 2015 So apparently Avril Lavigne is dead, and has been replaced by a look a like named Malissa. white cheddar (@Duda1Hayley) November 5, 2015 After reading theories about how Avril Lavigne is dead, I'm convinced this is true princess (@Arianaspoon) November 4, 2015 In summation, there is no truth behind the theory that Avril Lavigne killed herself and was replaced by an actress. This theory was created with the sole purpose of proving how easy it is to spread misinformation on the Internet. Well, mission accomplished.

 {"Origins":"Warnings about the dangers of using cellular phones in the presence of gasoline fumes began circulating on the Internet in 1999. Though both versions of the original Internet warning alluded to an accident in Indonesia wherein a driver was burned and his car badly damaged as a result of such an explosion, no reports ever surfaced in the news media to confirm the incident. Moreover, nothing turned up about similar explosions in other countries. If sparks from cell phones were touching off conflagrations at gas pumps around the world, as suggested at the time, the phenomenon escaped the media's notice. Such rumors were furthered in May 1999 when a lengthy article appeared in the Bangkok Post supporting this warning. It mentioned \"a recent report in the China Post newspaper\" and from there proceeded to parrot the warning given in the longer example quoted above, complete with reference to the report by Shell Chemicals on the injuries suffered by the man in Indonesia and the Chinese Petroleum Corporation's instructions to filling stations to get drivers to switch off their phones while fueling.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Okay, so the bit about a guy in Indonesia being turned into a human fireball didn't stand up. But what about persistent rumors concerning another supposed victim, this time an Australian man, supposedly done in by using his mobile phone as he refueled? Although in 1999 oil companies told the South China Morning Post they had heard reports of an Australian man being blown up recently when his phone rang as he was filling his car with gasoline, fire service heads in Australia insist the incident never happened. As for incidents elsewhere in the world, after several reports were circulated in the United States claiming mobile phones had been blamed for fires at gas stations, both the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the American Petroleum Institute issued statements denying the risk. The CTIA said, \"There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. Wireless phones don't cause gas stations to blow up. Warnings being posted in petrol stations simply perpetuate the myth.\" The American Petroleum Institute said, \"We can find no evidence of someone using a cellphone causing any kind of accident, no matter how small, at a gas station anywhere in the world.\" In June 2002 another authoritative-sounding warning on this subject began circulating on the Internet: The Shell Oil Company recently issued a warning about three incidents where Mobile Phones have ignited fumes while being answered or ringing during fueling operations. What specifically happened Case 1 The phone was placed on the car's trunk lid during fueling, it rang and the ensuing fire destroyed the car and the gasoline pump. Case 2 An individual suffered severe burns to their face when fumes ignited as they answered a call while refueling their car. Case 3 An individual suffered burns to the thigh and groin as fumes ignited when the phone, which was in their pocket, rang while they were fueling their car. What should you learn from this? It is a misconception that Mobile Phones are intrinsically safe and can't ignite fuel/fumes. Mobile phones that light up when switched on, or when they ring, have enough energy released to provide a spark for ignition. Mobile phones should not be used in filling stations, or when fueling lawn mowers, boats etc. Mobile phones should not be used around other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust (i.e. solvents, chemicals, gases, grain dust etc.). Mobile phones should be turned off before entering an area where other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust is located. Please share this with employees who do not have access to email, family members and friends to help keep everyone safe. Though we looked long and hard, we never found documentation confirming any of the three incidents described in the that warning. Moreover, Shell denied having issued a warning of this nature: We understand that there is an email, purportedly official Shell communication, circulating which describes various incidents that are supposed to have occurred as a result of mobile phones ringing while at a retail station. Please be advised that the email in question does NOT originate from Shell Malaysia and we are unable to confirm any of the incidents quoted. There was a warning memo which originated at a Shell loading station in California, but it was issued only to caution employees about the potential dangers of static-related hazards at fueling stations; it said nothing about cell phones touching off fires. (The \"three incidents\" e-mail quoted above was teamed with a separate warning about the hazards posed by static electricity, a topic covered on our Static Quo page.) Okay, so it hasn't happened yet. Is there still a potential, as yet unrealized risk in using cell phones while refueling? According to some experts, there is a danger that using a mobile phone near gas pumps could touch off an explosion, but not only have we found no real-life instances of such an explosion occurring, we don't know anyone who has demonstrated experimentally that it's even possible (including the folks at The Discovery Channel's Mythbusters program). Even so, gas pumps in Australia bear stickers cautioning motorists to turn off their phones while refueling; Shell in Malaysia has affixed similar stickers to each of its gas pumps; numerous pumps in the U.S.A. are similarly adorned; Canada's major gas pump operators have banned customers from using mobile phones while at the gas pump; and in 1999 the city of Cicero, Illinois, passed the first law in the USA banning the use of cellular phones at gas stations. All of this activity was in the nature of CYA cautions rather than a response to a documented hazard. Cellular phone manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson have said the risk is very small that something will happen when one uses a cell phone at a gas station, but since there is a risk, it should be counted. Nokia also said that the company has been recommending for a long time that mobile phones should be turned off while the car is being refueled. What it is about a cellular phone that could possibly trigger an explosion is difficult to fathom, however. The claim that the batteries used in a cellular phone can ignite gasoline seems specious, since cellular phone batteries are the same voltage as automobile batteries (12V D.C.) but deliver far less current. Likewise, the claim that a \"cellular phone ringer uses more than 100 volts for excitation\" is a curious artifact of the \"regular\" telephone era: cellular phones don't have ringers; they produce audio tones that simulate the sound of a ringing telephone. News reports routinely attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use whenever a fire occurs at a service station where such a phone was in use at the time, and police and firefighters at the scene often simply assume the connection between the two to be valid. Later investigations, however, have always shown in such cases that the press reports were wrong, that something else (usually a discharge of static electricity) touched off the fires, and the presence of cell phones was coincidental rather than causal.

All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, (intrinsically safe) while cell phones are not. READ YOUR HANDBOOK! Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites, and chemical factories.\" Exxon has begun placing \"warning stickers\" at its gasoline stations. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users is primarily the result of their ability to produce sparks that can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone. Please pass this on. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] *** PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS *** Mobile phones an explosive risk at gas stations. Switch off your mobile phone while filling your car. This is the latest advice for mobile phone users and gas station attendants alike from the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), which has recently informed all its affiliates to be on alert for people chatting on mobiles while pumping gas, a practice it asserts can cause explosions. \"There have been several explosions in Southeast Asia and Europe and we hope similar tragedies can be avoided in Taiwan,\" said David Tung from CPC's main engineering division. According to a report released by Shell Chemicals, a driver in Indonesia suffered burns and his car was severely damaged when petrol vapor exploded after being ignited by static electricity from the mobile phone he was using. Apparently, the driver had been talking on a mobile phone as a gas station attendant filled his car with petrol. When the driver bent down close to the petrol tank to check whether it was full, the vapor exploded. In Belgium, customers have been prohibited from using mobile phones within 10 meters of gas stations and warnings are posted everywhere to remind people of the danger, according to a Belgian newspaper. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users around the world is largely due to their ability to produce sparks. These can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone, which is itself, a possible cause of fire. But the electromagnetic waves emitted by the phone are more than sufficient to create considerable static electricity that heats the surrounding air and if the flammable vapor is concentrated enough, causes an explosion. But other electronic devices installed in the gas stations are safe. \"All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, while cellular phones are not,\" Tung explained. Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites and chemical factories.\" But the danger is still being ignored by many users who continue to talk on their cellular phones while filling up at gas stations. \"Asking them to turn off the phone is the only thing we can do now, but not all the users like to : some of them even get mad with me,\" one attendant at a gas station complained. In fact, if danger is to be avoided, all transmitting devices - not just mobile phones - should be switched off near gas stations and locations housing flammable substances. Mobile phones should also be switched off near sensitive electronic equipment, in places such as hospitals and airports for public safety reasons.

While the meme has been shared with various photos and on several different platforms, there is no evidence that the comedian actually uttered the above-quoted phrase. The quote \"I m suspicious of people who don t like dogs, but I trust a dog when it doesn't like a person,\" was a popular meme long before Murray's name was attached to it. While the exact origins of the phrase are unknown, the earliest mention of the phrase on Twitter that we could uncover was posted in October 2011: Murray's name didn't become attached to the phrase until November 2014, when it was posted by a parody account: The @BillMurray Twitter account makes it clear that it is not run by the comedian: I AM NOT BILL MURRAY. This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray While the above-displayed quote has been attributed to Bill Murray on IMDB, The Daily Quotes, and dozens of social media memes, there is no record of the comedian actually uttering the above-displayed phrase.

 {"Origins":"The belief that red cars attract more speeding tickets than do their less rosily-hued counterparts is a cherished motoring factoid of long standing. By its lights, the gendarmes are more likely to sit up and take notice of speeding red cars than they are vehicles of other colors, hence the higher incidence of moving violation citations accumulated by owners of red cars.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Explanations abound as to why red cars would attract more speeding citations than is their statistical fair share. It has been postulated that red, being an especially eye-catching color, unduly attracts the attention of the highway patrol, therefore even when every car on the road is whipping past at 20 mph over the speed limit, it's the rubicund chariots that suddenly discover flashing lights in their rearview mirrors. Another theory has it that a color-prompted optical illusion makes red cars appear to be going faster than they actually are and so works to get them clocked more often by John Law. Color-influenced driver behavior has also been suggested, with the rubious shade of such vehicles working to increase their drivers' breathing and heart rates, which in turn incites those behind the wheel to drive faster without their consciously being aware of having made that decision. Another line of reasoning ties assumptions made about sports cars (that people who own them tend to drive fast) to red's being one of the most popular colors for such vehicles if sports cars are ticketed more often, and more sports cars tend to be red, then red cars would earn proportionally more speeding tickets than would vehicles of other colors. They're great theories, one and all. Problem is, their premise is flawed as it does not appear that red cars get cited for speeding more often than they statistically should. Whenever they've been asked about the rumor, police across the U.S. have consistently denied any connection between vehicle color and tickets issued or the allegation that they write up the drivers of red cars more often than they do other motorists. Said Sgt. Thornnie Rouse, a trooper with the Maryland State Police for more than 20 years: \"You don't care about the car's color, you care about the violation. If a red car and a green car drive past you and the green car is going 30 mph over the speed limit, the driver of the green car is the one who is going to get stopped.\" Similarly, Sgt. Thomas Miller of Clearwater, Florida's traffic enforcement unit said, \"It's not the color of the car that matters, it's how fast it's going.\" Likewise, a California Highway Patrol officer we asked about this rumor asserted it's drivers doing something different or unusual that catch the eyes of highway patrolmen, regardless of the color of their vehicles. But of course such statements aren't in and of themselves disproof of anything, because police might well not recognize their own bias when it comes to which vehicles they choose to pursue. Yet what those in law enforcement have had to say on this topic over the years finds support in the one and only study (informal or otherwise) we could locate about correlation of car color to speeding tickets. In an attempt to prove or disprove the belief, in 1990 a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times conducted his own smallish survey of which color of cars were getting the most speeding tickets in his area. He first staked out four intersections in the two counties he was studying and made a tally by color of vehicle of the 1,198 cars that went through them. He then leafed through the most recent 924 speeding citations issued in those two counties to arrive at a count of how many had been issued to each color of car. Last, he compared the two results to see if the resultant percentages closely approximated one another or were badly out of sync. His findings challenged the belief about red cars being dunned with proportionally more of the speeding tickets. Red cars accounted for 14 percent of the local vehicle population and about 16 percent of the citations for speeding, which is not a significant difference. Surprisingly, his informal study did reveal certain statistically significant differences, but they had to do with other colors of vehicle. White cars, which accounted for 25 percent of the local vehicle population, received only 19 percent of the tickets, which meant such jalopies were cited for their transgressions less often than they should have been. This raises a new hypothesis: Rather than red attracting the unwelcome attentions of the highway patrol, perhaps instead it is the case that police tend not to notice white vehicles that are breaking the law. Gray cars were the ones that gained a greater share of the speeding tickets than they statistically should have: while they accounted for only 6 percent of cars on the road, they pulled down 10 percent of the tickets issued. On the flip side, silver cars got only 5 percent of the tickets, yet they represented 10 percent of the car population. In addition to the \"earn more speeding tickets than they should\" theory, other mistaken beliefs attach to red cars: They are widely thought to be stolen more often or be involved in a greater number of accidents: [Collected via e-mail, 2005] I continuously hear the rumor that statistics \"prove\" that red cars are stolen more than any other color, even to the extent that insurance companies are wary with red cars, due to the increased theft factor. Red car owners thus have higher rates. The idea is that the color red attracts car thieves, I guess like hummingbirds. Those in the automobile insurance business deny they're charging more to insure red cars than comparable vehicles of other colors, and this would not be the case if red cars were more likely to be stolen or involved in accidents. Regarding the belief that a vehicle's color drives up its insurance premiums, says Jeanne Salvatore, vice president for consumer affairs for the Insurance Information Institute in New York City: \"It's not the color, it's your driving record.\" She's never heard of any insurance company charging more for red cars. However, rates are often higher for sports cars of any color, as they are more expensive to buy and repair and are stolen more often. The belief that red cars get ticketed more frequently for speeding has led to the development of an urban legend about police officers adapting the billiards game of snooker to their work: [Healey & Glanvill, 1996] A friend of a friend was determined to find a career where he could serve the public, be a useful member of society and make something of himself. But he joined the police force instead. Breezing through the basic training, he quickly found himself 'partnered' with an old hand on traffic control. They had a cracking Range Rover jam sandwich to cruise around in and the new rozzer was thoroughly enjoying the work. There was only one problem - his partner. He naturally respected his senior's experience, but some of his operational decisions were questionable, to say the least. One day they were peacefully poised on a ramp by the motorway hard shoulder when the rookie spotted a flagrant abuse of Her Majesty's speed regulations. He eagerly pointed out the culprit. The older man simply looked up, screwed his eyes, shrugged, and carried on reading his paper. This happened four or five times before the older cop set off in hot pursuit and pulled an offender in a red car. This chain of events recurred throughout their shift: the older man ignoring some offenders and booking others seemingly on a whim. The lad initially kept his own counsel, but when his superior pulled yet another red car, he could take no more. 'Now l-look,' quavered the youngster, slamming down a Biro symbolically. 'Just what do you think you're blimming well playing at?' 'Snooker,' came the sharp reply. 'First you stop a red car, one point. Then a black car - that's seven - and so on until after 15 reds we go on to the colours. Every force in the country plays it.' And then, flicking shut the youngster's gawping mouth, he added: 'I got a maximum 147 break last week.' BBC News offered the following tongue-in-cheek advice to motorists looking to avoid being bagged in the non-existent game of highway snooker: 1) Don't drive red cars - because there are 15 reds on a snooker table, the reds are much more likely to get potted. 2) Similarly, don't drive black cars. Although they may look sleek, stylish, moody and expensive, earning seven points makes them the top target. 3) It's probably not a good idea to drive pink cars either. Not only are they high scorers, but the chances of looking sleek, stylish, moody or expensive are slim. 4) If you don't have a red car, you should still be wary. Driving behind them could make you liable for a swift one-two, with you both being \"potted\" in swift succession. 5) In the rules of the game, yellow, green and brown should be fairly safe bets, as they are low scoring. Getting a bad position after a red might give a playing officer no choice, though. 6) White cars are safest of all. Police cars, being white, act as the cue ball in the game. So if a white car is booked, it is tantamount to a foul and will count as four points away. Luckily for all concerned, the BBC then redeemed itself by proffering this eminently sensible suggestion: \"Simplest of all, and surely the advice straight-faced coppers would give, is don't speed and you won't be caught.\" Barbara \"unsnookered\" Mikkelson Sightings: In an episode of the television comedy The Big Bang Theory (\"The Euclid Alternative,\" original air date 20 October 2008), Sheldon insists that he not be given a red car in the simulator provided to teach him driving skills, stating they get more speeding tickets.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.billiardworld.com/snooker.html;","Example":"After recently buying a red car I have been advised by many people, each with the voice of authority, that police are known to stop red cars more often than those of any other color. This has a distinct ring of Urban Legend to my ears, but I thought I'd ask whether you folks know about it.","Last Updated":"12 June

 {"Origins":"On 28 August 2015, a web site using the domain MSMBC.co (unrelated to the legitimate MSNBC news outlet, which can be found at MSNBC.com), published an article reporting that actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (who also served as governor of California from 2003-2011) had passed away from a heart attack at age 68: Arnold Schwarzenegger was found dead at his Las Angeles [sic], California home. Schwarzenegger was 68 years old.","Fact Check":"Has actor (and former California governor) Arnold Schwarzenegger passed away from a heart attack?","Description":"Police responded to the L.A. home after receiving a 911 emergency call for a unresponsive male . Upon entering the residence, police found Schwarzenegger s deceased body in his bed. We found Mr. Schwarzenegger in his bedroom deceased around 9:30 pm on Wednesday, said Las Angeles Police Chief James J. Freda [sic] in a brief statement to Local 4 CBS News [sic]. \"We found no reason to believe foul play was a factor in his death but intent [sic] to perform a full investigation.\" There is no truth to the above-quoted story. This rumor originated with a fake news web site that uses the domain MSMBC.co in order to trick readers into believing that they are reading reports from the MSNBC.com news organization. While MSMBC.co does not contain a readily available disclaimer, the web site's pitch for new writers does shed some light about the quality of the web site's content: No experience needed! If you have internet access and the ability to type then you are qualified. Best of all we will pay you if it s good. You talk directly to the editors no form letter rejections. Your work could be seen by millions of people. We are looking for highly unqualified individuals (qualified people are welcome too) familiar with writing, photoshop, infographics, videos, and apps.

 {"Origins":"On 30 August 2015, Facebook user Aria Brown shared a post reporting that professional political troll Ann Coulter had referred to President Obama as a \"retard\" in a tweet. That Facebook post, which also included a response from Special Olympics athlete John Franklin Stephens, quickly went viral and racked up more than a half million shares in 24 hours:","Fact Check":"Did Ann Coulter refer to President Obama as a \"retard,\" prompting a response from a Special Olympics athlete?","Description":"Some people who viewed the Facebook post questioned its authenticity, as they couldn't find the \"Obama retard\" tweet in Coulter's Twitter feed. The reason for that was because the referenced comment was one she made after a 2012 presidential debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, not something Coulter said in 2015 as implied by the Facebook post: Shortly after the tweet made headlines in 2012, Ann Coulter appeared on Alan Colmes' Fox News radio show to double down on her trolling: \"Look, no one would refer to a Down Syndrome child, someone with an actual mental handicap, by saying 'retard.' Where do you think the words 'imbecile,' 'idiot,' 'moron,' 'cretin' come from? These were all technical terms at one time. 'Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years ... But no, no these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\" The response from Special Olympics athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens is also real, although also not recent. On 23 October 2012, Stephens posted it as open letter to Coulter on the Special Olympics Blog: Dear Ann Coulter, Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren t dumb and you aren t shallow. So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? I m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow. I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you. In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night. I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are and much, much more. After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me. You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV. I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much. Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged.

 {"Origins":"Everyone is in favor of keeping drunk drivers off the road, but no one ever wants to think of himself as falling into that category. For this reason, we adore the notion of little easy-to-do tricks that will keep us, the occasional overindulgers, from being rounded up and tossed into the hoosegow as if we were actual miscreants who make our roads dangerous. It's not for those lawless killers who routinely get totaled then slip behind the wheel of a car, you understand. It's for us, the ordinary folk who get pulled over that one time we had a drink on our way home.","Fact Check":"","Description":"All imaginary halos and denials aside, none of these tricks work. Pennies held in the mouth no more fool the breathalyzer than would hopping on one foot while reciting the Lord's Prayer. There's nothing magical about the presumed copper content of a one-cent piece that negates the test. (From 1982 on, the U.S. one-cent coin has been made of 97.5% zinc encased in a copper coating.) Likewise, although mints and various other breath treatments are at least somewhat effective at masking the odor of alcohol on the tippler's breath, they do nothing to affect the presence of demon rum in that person's system. In other words, even if the smell is not detectable, the alcohol itself is. Older breathalyzers measured the chemical reaction between the amount of alcohol expelled on the breath and the contents of a vial in a breathalyzer machine. Newer machines measure breath alcohol by the process of infrared absorption, which entails passing an infrared light wave through a sample chamber containing the subject's breath, then measuring the drop in the intensity of the light and using that to calculate the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath. It's important to delay the test for 20 minutes after the person being examined has had a drink else \"mouth alcohol\" might interfere with the results. (Traces of booze generally remain in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes after a drink is taken. The 20 minute deprivation period allowed for this to dissipate.) Additionally, many police officers assert breathalyzer results can be compromised by the subject's burping while being tested (which they believe would increase the presence of mouth alcohol). That belief is more lore than science: According to a 1992 study performed at the Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, belching had no effect on breathalyzer results. In one study subjects belched and blew into the instrument 15 minutes after taking a drink of alcohol; the reading was recorded then compared to another reading taken one minute later. There was no difference. Even when people would bring up a belch of gas directly into the instrument, there was no effect. Folks have done many strange things over the years in an effort to beat the machine. In a case heard in an Alberta courtroom in March 1985, 28-year-old Dave Zurfluh, who was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, ate his undershorts in the belief they would soak up the excess alcohol in his system. According to Constable Bill Robinson, the arresting officer, he heard \"some ripping and tearing\" from the back of the cruiser. \"I looked in the back and he was tearing pieces of the crotch of his underwear out and stuffing them in his mouth,\" Robinson testified. We've no idea if the eating of the shorts was what got him off, but Dave Zurfluh was acquitted of all charges because he'd blown .08 on the breathalyzer, the legal limit. In March 2005 a 59-year-old accused drunk driver in Ontario tried to foil a police breathalyzer by stuffing his mouth full of feces. He had been taken to the police station for testing, where he grabbed a handful of his own waste \"and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine,\" said Sgt. James Buchanan of the South Simcoe Police. It didn't work. The machine registered two readings of intoxication from samples the suspect provided. Both were more than twice the legal limit. As for the \"penny\" canard, that too has been tried in real life. In August 2000, one East Hampton man pulled over for drunk driving was discovered to be sucking on a penny when approached for a breathalyzer sample. His speech was slurred, he couldn't stand up straight, and he failed all the standard sobriety tests, yet still he had faith in the \"penny under the tongue\" trick to save the day. The notion that \"smell of booze equals booze itself\" fuels the erroneous belief that breath improvers are effective counters to the breathalyzer test. Possibly in an attempt to cash in on this confusion, in 1997 a British company began marking \"Breathalyzer Blitz,\" mints advertised for their ability to rid breath of alcohol odors. The spokespeople for Blitz Design Corp. were always upfront in their denials that their mints would negate breathalyzer test results, but the name of the confection itself might well have misled many into believing these particular candies would have that effect. Also, those whose tipple of choice was Zima (a sweet colorless beverage especially favored by the younger set) were often under the mistaken impression that the booze in that particular concoction was not detectable via breathalyzer examination. Because Zima leaves little smell on the breath, its devotees concluded the alcohol contained in the beverage itself would prove similarly hard to pin down. They were wrong, of course, because Zima contained about the same amount of alcohol as ordinary beer, and the breathalyzer would always pick up on that. Yet this tidbit of lore proved surprisingly hardy and was often swapped among teens as a \"Did you know?\" revelation. Barbara \"leaving the zima of the crime\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 1994] A distant friend relayed this one. He was drunk and a cop pulled him over. He said the first thing he did was stuff a handful of pennies in his mouth and then spit them out as the officer approached the car. He said a short time later he was given a breathalizer test and because of the copper alloy residue (or whatever) the breathalizer tester went bonkers and they couldn't get an accurate evaluation and was off the hook. [Collected on the Internet, 2001] Here's something I heard a little over a year ago supposedly from a friend of a friend. At the time my friend told me that he heard that several states were trying to outlaw Icebreakers gum because it would disguise alcoholic content in breathalyzer tests and the readings would come out negative. As far as I know, Icebreakers is still being sold and I have yet to hear about a real lawsuit or a law being made to stop it.","Last Updated":"9 April

 {"Origins":"In October 2015, links began circulating on Facebook promising users a free case of Barefoot Cellars wine as a celebration of the brand's 50th anniversary: The embedded links involved a variety of URLs, some of which included entirely unrelated scam-bait terms like \"iTunes\" and \"Apple.\" Users who clicked through to claim their purported free case of Barefoot wine were routed to a page reading \"Barefoot Wine is Giving FREE Cases of Wine to celebrate 50th Anniversary (230 Left),\" which cloned the style of Facebook-based content (but was hosted on a non-Facebook URL):","Fact Check":"","Description":"As noted, URLs visible in the posts didn't point to any credible domains or sites linked to Barefoot Cellars. By now, most social media users are familiar with survey scams: Kohl's, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's, Kroger, Best Buy, Macy's, Olive Garden, Publix, Target, and Walmart are among retailers used as bait by scammers (seeking personal information and valuable page likes from Facebook users). A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureau illustrated how folks might spot and avoid bad actors utilizing the reputations of brands on social media: Don't believe what you see. It's easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. When in doubt, do a quick web search. If the survey is a scam, you may find alerts or complaints from other consumers. The organization's real website may have further information. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $$50 gift cards for completing a few questions.

 {"Origins":"In June 2015, a \"Sub-Urban Life Hack\" video that purported to show how a rotten banana could be \"resurrected\" through the use of a bag of rice and a hair dryer was spread widely via Facebook:","Fact Check":"Can a rotten banana be \"resurrected\" through the use of rice and a hair dryer?","Description":"This video has been online since at least July 2014, when it was posted to YouTube by Brandon Queen, who offered this explanation for the banana-resurrecting phenomenon it seemingly depicts: The rice works as an antioxidant and pulls out any excess moisture from the banana. Then the blow dryer artificially simulates thermogenesis by speeding up the retro-fermentation process by activating the polyphosphates and preservatives which essentially reverse-ages the banana. This only works with conventional store bought bananas that use various herbicides, polyphosphates and pesticides. Although this explanation includes scientific-sounding phrases such as \"retro-fermentation\" and \"thermogenesis,\" there is nothing scientific about it. You can not resurrect a rotten banana with rice and a hair dryer. Of course, you can try. On 12 June 2015, YouTube user Crystal Phillips did just that, capturing on video her attempt to recreate this life hack which resulted in nothing more than her ending up with the same \"yucky\" banana she started with: A few theories about how the original video managed to create the illusion of \"resurrecting\" an old banana have been advanced, such as the use of a frozen banana: According to Chow, the peel of a banana will turn black once it has been placed in a freezer, while the meat of the banana will remain fresh (and the video never shows the actual state of the fruit itself prior to its \"resurrection\" so that viewers can ascertain it really was \"rotten\" to begin with): Bananas, like other tropical fruits, are prone to \"chilling injury\"; that is, damage from cold storage. The most obvious sign of it is when yellow banana skins turn black after refrigeration. If the bananas were fully ripened before you refrigerated them, they'll still be fine to eat, though they ll be mushy and the flesh might also have turned brown. The seeming color change of the banana peels could have been accomplished in a number of ways, from digital editing and lighting manipulation to the addition or removal of a coloring agent from its skin.

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, the entertainment web site Link Beef published an article reporting that hotel mogul James Horton was offering to pay one thousand women $$10,000 per month each, for life, to bear his children and help him create the world's largest family: Jewish Hotel mogul James Horton wants to have the biggest family in the world. So much so that he has offered to pay $$10,000 each month for life to any woman that has a child with him.","Fact Check":"Is Jewish hotel mogul James Horton recruiting one thousand women to bear his children and create \"the biggest family in the world\"?","Description":"Horton has offered to house 1000 women in one of his 5 star hotels for up to 2 years while he conceives a child with any woman he chooses. Horton has had over 22,000 entries and has selected around 250 women so far. Horton has said that he will be selecting women based on their looks from pictures they submit to his website. After the initial selection, the candidates are invited to his mansion in Beverly Hills, where she will then go through an interview process with Horton. If they pass this test, they go through a medical screening process and tested for any STD s. After selection, the lucky lady then moves into his 5 star hotel, where Horton will copulate with all the women until they are pregnant. There is no truth to the above-displayed story. While Link Beef does not include a readily available disclaimer on their site indicating they are purveyors of fake news, several factors identify this article as fiction: First, \"Jewish Hotel Mogul James Horton\" doesn't seem to exist. The only mention of his name on the Internet is connected to the above-quoted article. Second, the photographs included in the article are not related to \"James Horton\" nor to the women he has supposedly selected to create the world's biggest family. The first image shows the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills (part of Montage Hotels & Resorts founded in 2002 by Alan Fuerstman) and not a hotel owned by \"James Horton\": The second image is a promotional photograph for Wonderbra's Multiplunge bra and not, as claimed by Link Beef, the \"250 ladies Horton already selected posed for a photo shoot yesterday\": In addition to deceiving readers with a fake news article, Link Beef also claimed that Horton had set up a web site at the domain BillionaireBaby.org in order to receive applications from prospective female \"family members\" interesting in bearing his children: Although it's unclear who owns BillionaireBaby.org or what intent of the web site is (beyond something set up merely to lend credence to a fake news story), it's highly unlikely that anyone submitting photographs to it will get to experience an extended stay at a luxury hotel, a large monetary stipend, and impregnation by a fictional billionaire hotel mogul. Link Beef has previously published fake stories about a gang member attempting to gold plate his genitals, a \"lab-grown\" baby, and a castaway being rescued with the help of Google Earth.

 {"Origins":"On 26 June 2015, the Supreme Court's decision in the case Obergefell vs. Hodges [PDF] held that same-sex couples were guaranteed the right to marry under both the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Almost immediately, that decision led to a number of rumors and viral claims; that pedophiles would soon be granted similar rights, that Joe Biden had gone on a victory spree, and that Facebook had begun tracking the political beliefs of users via a celebratory rainbow filter for profile pictures.) Tangential rumors circulated pertaining to individuals and businesses who subsequently (or previously) went out on a limb for their religious opposition to marriage equality, which included a false claim involving a pastor purportedly jailed for refusing to marry a gay couple and the true case of an Oregon bakery ordered to pay damages stemming from a pre-decision refusal to serve a same-sex couple. The meme displayed above was inspired by Kentucky court clerk named Kim Davis, who unwittingly starred in a viral video during which she refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple shortly after the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling.","Fact Check":"Did Kentucky hire an Amish DMV clerk who refused to issue driver's licenses based on her religious beliefs?","Description":"On 12 August 2015, U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning ordered Davis [PDF] to begin issuing licenses as requested. Bunning wrote in his ruling that by \"openly adopting a policy that promotes her own religious convictions at the expenses of others,\" Davis had violated the law, adding: Davis remains free to practice her Apostolic Christian beliefs. She may continue to attend church twice a week, participate in Bible Study and minister to female inmates at the Rowan County Jail. She is even free to believe that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, as many Americans do. However, her religious convictions cannot excuse her from performing the duties that she took an oath to perform as Rowan County Clerk. The humorous image above was clearly created to poke fun at Davis over the legal dispute (and the general issue of allowing personal religious beliefs to trump the requirements of employment and public service), a subtlety lost on many social media users who hadn't heard of the marriage license controversy in Kentucky and consequently didn't get the joke. The jape partially relies outsider assumptions about Amish culture, one of which is the notion that Amish people are prohibited from driving due to their religion. That's not precisely accurate, as use of a horse-and-buggy over cars is primarily a cultural choice and not part of a specific anti-automobile religious edict applied to everyone: Although the Amish are allowed to use automobiles for social and business functions, the church rules prohibit members from owning as well as driving a car. Amish businessmen are also not allowed to provide loans to non-Amish employees for the purpose of buying a vehicle. Ownership of an automobile is considered a taboo. It is important to the community to maintain the horse and buggy as a symbol of Amish identity. The joke also leans on a (fallacious) assumption that Amish citizens neither seek nor require state driver's licenses, part of a broad, inaccurate perception of the community as frightened of the outside world. The Amish often need state-issued ID for a variety of day-to-day purposes, including the operation of lucrative businesses (contrary to the belief Amish people reject wealth and/or financial success entirely or that they lack awareness of modern conventions). Photographic requirements have presented problems for Amish people seeking licenses, however, as their traditions generally favor the avoidance of photography. (Yet another misconception asserts the practice is due to a primitive, uneducated fear that the camera might \"steal\" a person's soul; in actuality, it's more due to intentional humility and not a fear of technology.) While the meme seen here satirizes the imposition of religious belief on outsiders by a presumably stricter sect, it should be noted that Amish communities are known for a marked disinclination to interact with the \"English\" world save for necessary circumstances. Although their religious beliefs are notoriously stringent, Amish folks are far likelier to be encroached upon by a conflict of law and faith than the other way around.

First, this is a brand new Twitter account which was started on 3 January 2016. While it is possible that Bundy would start a new Twitter account to take advantage of the media attention, the rancher has had a Facebook account for more than a year and frequently uses the social network to provide updates from Oregon. Second, the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account uses a screenshot from one of Bundy's videos as its profile pic. If the account were real, it's likely that Bundy would have used an actual photo. Finally, MSNBC reporter Tony Dokoupil, who has been reporting from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since shortly after Bundy's men took over the building, confirmed that the account was fake: While it's possible that someone associated with the Bundy is operating the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account, it's more likely that the account is being operated by a remote sympathizer.

 {"Origins":"On 6 November 2015, a Facebook user shared the above-reproduced image with the caption \"102 pound shrimp from Homosassa Florida.\" Aside from the concise purported description no other information was provided about the image (such as date taken), and it previously appeared on 30 September 2015 on a Spanish-language web site. In that iteration, the photo wasn't rumored to have been taken in Florida. A roughly translated excerpt placed the implausible catch in Spain:","Fact Check":"","Description":"The image shows a man proudly posing with giant prawn or shrimp, at least fifteen kilos of weight. The commentary accompanying the photo Ascent Sunday the Facebook group \"Asturias our land\" (with almost 2,700 members) - is as follows: \"Shrimp fish yesterday in the Asturian coast ... We big .. .! Pa a \"tapina '. Puxa!.\" Within hours the \"news\" circulated like wildfire and generated discussion threads among those who appreciated the humorous nature of the case and those who believed it. Once again, a hoax on the network (\"hoax\" in English) came to be taken as credible as if it were a proven information with rigor and professionalism. Google had yet another locale for the well-traveled fish, as a reverse image search automatically suggested Queensland as photo's location (discussed in an August 2015 forum thread). A separate search by image showed that the photograph was originally uploaded in 2010; it could have been taken (or altered) far earlier. The 2010 result led to a dead link, but was hosted on a web site for a fishing club in the Florida Keys (presumably, a catch of that nature would warrant a mention by avid sport fishermen). On 4 September 2014, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission published a status update to Facebook reporting the capture of a large, shrimp-like creature measuring 18 inches long: Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Those photographs didn't match the circulating \"102 lb. shrimp\" image, and the crustacean depicted wasn't technically a shrimp. The documented catch occurred in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida and a weight wasn't provided. Professor of integrative biology Roy Caldwell told LiveScience that the 2014 find was unlikely to have occurred as described, and that photography was an unreliable barometer of mantis shrimp size: The specimen caught in Florida belongs to a species of Lysiosquilla, according to Caldwell. Like other members of its species, the creature has three pairs of walking legs and a large, articulated abdomen, Caldwell noted. \"This particular group Lysiosquillidae are almost all banded yellow and black across their bodies,\" Caldwell said. They can live for 30 years and can grow to be 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) long, he added ... this specimen doesn't belong to the largest of stomatopod species, according to the biologist. That distinction goes to Lysiosquillina maculata, which inhabit the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to east Africa. Caldwell said the largest known members of the species were 15 inches (38 cm) long. Caldwell, who said he's been studying stomatopods for 50 years, said an 18-inch catch is unlikely. Photos, he pointed out, can sometimes be deceiving. He also noted that, with its claws extended, a stomatopod tends to look much longer than it really is. The standard for measuring the creatures is from the tip of the eye to the end of the tail claws not included. Marine biologists doubted that the purported 18-inch long mantis shrimp was as big as estimates claimed in 2014, and it was thrown back almost immediately (preventing further examination). Moreover, the documented newsworthy crustacean catch occurred in September 2014, whereas the viral photo of indeterminate origin existed as early as March 2010.

 {"Origins":"James Brown, the energetic soul singer famous for such top ten hits as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" as well as his trademark dance routines (such as his famous one-legged shimmy), has been tagged with many different nicknames during his more than fifty years in the music business: the Funky President, the Godfather of Soul, Soul Brother No. 1, the Ambassador of Soul, the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, and Mr. Dynamite. It was his wife, however, who made the most creative use of one of these sobriquets, when it was offered in her defense in an attempt to beat misdemeanor traffic charges.","Fact Check":"","Description":"On 3 September 1987, Brown's wife Adrienne was stopped in Georgia and charged with driving under the influence of drugs, speeding, and criminal trespass. She pleaded innocent to the charges, but before her case came to trial in June 1988, her lawyer tried a novel defense: diplomatic immunity. Back in 1986, the city of Augusta, Georgia, had held a James Brown Appreciation Day, and on that day, U.S. Representative Douglas Barnard of Georgia delivered a laudatory speech in which he stated that \"James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.\" So, Adrienne Brown's lawyer, Allen W. Johnson, made a motion before the court offering Rep. Barnard's statement from two years earlier as proof of James Brown's ambassadorial status, maintaining that Brown was \"America's No. 1 ambassador and as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends to his wife, the accused herein.\" The ploy didn't work. Johnson withdrew the motion the next day, claiming that he had filed it only because he was pressed for time and \"was trying to pursue every possible avenue of defense,\" and that he had \"since determined that the congressman intended his comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech,\" not as a literal recognition of Brown's ambassadorial status. In any case, Johnson's motion was bound to fail: Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United States, and United States officials while they represent America in other countries. Such immunity therefore does not extend to American citizens who commit crimes in the USA, ambassadors or not.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"9 November

 {"Origins":"The growing encroachment of social media into every area of life hasn't necessarily led to a rise in foolish teenage behavior, but it does seem to be fueling misguided parental ideas about how teenagers conspire to spend their free time. The idea that dangerous social media challenges are popular seems to be on the upswing. The ice bucket challenge of mid-2014 may well have inspired the increase in social media challenge fads; but parental fears of largely non-existent practices such as \"rainbow parties,\" vodka-infused tampons, bedbug smoking, and 'beezin preceded it.","Fact Check":"Are teenagers daring one another to participate in the 72-hour challenge \"Game of 72,\" then disappearing for several days?","Description":"In 2015, anxious parents feared that the paracetamol challenge would inspire their children to overdose on over-the-counter painkillers; and in the same vein, the 72-hour challenge (also known as the \"Game of 72\") prompted concerns that kids were participating in a pointless and dangerous social media fad. In April 2015, the Daily Mail published a thinly-sourced article titled \"Parents left terrified by cruel new 'game' on Facebook that sees children dare each other to vanish for 72 hours without telling relatives.\" As with other panics of similar nature, the article breathlessly described a \"game\" that sounded of no real interest to teens whatsoever and included scant evidence that participants were actually undertaking the purported challenge: An alleged Facebook game which sees children dare each other to vanish without a trace for up to three days is spreading panic among parents in France. The dare, dubbed the 'Game of 72', involves teenagers challenging each other to disappear without a word to their families for 12, 24 or 72 hours. Authorities have been alerted to the game after a 13-year-old girl from northern France went missing for three days. So far, police say, the only evidence is dozens of panicked Facebook posts being shared by parents, warning each other about the game, and Emma's testimony, to suggest the challenge exists. That article referenced France's The Local, whose original article (also published on 29 April 2015) was far plainer in describing what was in all likelihood a classic urban legend of the crime-warning variety. The article admitted that the \"Game of 72 could even be more of a hoax than an actual phenomenon\" but went on to say that the \"fact that officials are taking the incident seriously is perhaps unsurprising given France's troubling history when it comes to dangerous social media crazes\": News of the latest challenge came after a 13-year-old girl from northern France who went missing for three days finally turned up safe and well at her home at the weekend. The girl, named Emma in the French press, reportedly refused to tell police or her parents where she had been or whom she had been with, but simply said she had taken on a dare through Facebook called '12, 24, 72' or 'Game of 72', as it is also known. The Facebook challenge, meanwhile, has left authorities baffled not least because they've been unable to actually find examples of it online. Rather, they've uncovered plenty of panicked postings from parents who are eager to warn each other about the game. This one below says \"Attention Danger!\" and warns of \"another stupid game doing the rounds on the net\". It tells parents to explain to their children that its better to fail the dare rather have \"something tragic happen to them.\" The fact that a 13-year-old girl in France named Emma disappeared for three days at some point in April 2015 has been proffered as the sole piece of evidence documenting that the \"Game of 72\" is a real phenomenon. But there's just one problem that story about Emma doesn't check out: Francois Perain, the prosecutor in Valenciennes, the district where the incident took place, [said] that the game \"seems to be an excuse\". \"Actually we think that Emma joined up with someone when she ran away, and that was the main reason for her running away,\" he said. \"Everything points to the fact that the game (which may be imaginary) is the explanation that Emma gave as the reason why she ran away, and to protect the person she met. That person is currently being looked for by the police,\" he said. Aside from that discredited story, the only evidence such a \"challenge\" had occurred consisted of ping-ponging warnings among French parents on social media sites issued after the fact. Moreover, no one was even sure if the kids participating were hiding for 12, 24, or 72 hours. It took about a week for the Game of 72 to make its way to North America, but by that point a \"small number\" of \"temporary disappearances in Europe\" had stolen French Emma's thunder: Halton police are warning parents to talk to their children about a dangerous new game allegedly making the rounds on social media known as the Game of 72. It encourages young people to disappear and stay hidden for 72 hours without contacting friends or family, said police. The Game of 72 is being blamed for a small number of temporary disappearances in Europe, but so far, no missing person cases have been attributed to it in Canada or the U.S., according to media reports. Even so, the game had Vancouver police worried enough to issue a warning about it earlier this week. (\"Possibly one, maybe not\" is indeed a very small number, and it should be noted that a social media challenge is a far better excuse to one's parents than \"I snuck out and was scared to come home\" or \"I ran away and changed my mind.\") At around the same time, scattered police departments began to warn parents about the terrifying new craze: On 7 May 2015, Mic published an article that cast doubt on whether the 72-hour challenge was a genuine teen fad or media invention. And much like the February 2015 rumor of measles parties, it seemed news outlets reached to find \"evidence\" of police concern about the purported trend: \"We never issued a warning about the game as has been reported,\" Constable Brian Montague, a spokesman for the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), said. \"We responded to questions about it from media and unfortunately they turned it into a warning from police.\" The VPD was featured in a recent news story about the fad, which included an interview with an online awareness expert. \"The game's popularity shows that parents need to stay up to the minute on their kids' computer habits,\" the story reads. On the contrary, Montague told Mic, the department hasn't come across any instances of the game in Vancouver. \"I am not even aware of any confirmed examples in Canada,\" he said. A lack of any confirmed incidents whatsoever and a corresponding absence of any social media chatter (aside from people wondering why kids would undertake the 72-hour challenge) didn't discourage news outlets from advancing the rumor once again in June 2015: https://twitter.com/EyesOfARedWolf/status/611126365379784704 In a thread published by Kathy Sweeney of Southeastern Missouri television station KFVS, numerous users speculated that multiple reported disappearances were linked to the game. Sweeney claimed a \"Facebook page\" was \"encouraging\" kids to participate (but appeared to be unable to produce a link to it) and reiterated the unsupported assertion that the \"game\" had first appeared in Europe: There's even a Facebook page dedicated to it please share to warn other parents! ... Not sure but it apparently already made the rounds in Europe. As BBC Trending blogger Mike Wendling observed about the \"Game of 72\": For a \"game\" that is supposedly catching on all over the world, there's scant chatter about it on social media. Only a few hundred tweets have been sent about the \"game\" most referencing news articles. Facebook searches in English and French throw up relatively few hits and again, most link to media reports. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which runs the UK's best-known helpline for children, told Trending that they haven't received any calls about the \"game\". Some of the coverage of the \"game\" compared it to other trends such as neknomination the viral challenge where people were egging friends on to complete a dangerous and/or drinking-related stunt. But whereas neknomination was a real thing as were other potentially dangerous games such as the \"cinnamon challenge\" the \"game of 72\" appears to be nothing more than a lost-in-translation rumour.

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, the above-displayed image (of an exceptionally large, Sicilian-style pizza) and a caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $$218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $$1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme). The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain. A small graphic displayed on the chain's web site alluded to the pizza challenge, as well as a prize of \"up to $$1,000\":","Fact Check":"Does a photograph show a real (giant) pizza, part of a challenge in which intrepid diners can win $$1,000?","Description":"However, that linked image led only to a \"coming soon\" message which offered no information about the pizza challenge or its stipulations. We reached out to Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria's corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria locations in Southern California, five currently possess the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge is most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location. Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54\" by 54\", and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $$235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza. The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, so far only two contestant teams have managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $$1,000 prize.

 {"Origins":"Photographs purportedly showing bananas that had been \"injected with blood\" have been passed around online with varying degrees of paranoia for several years. The claims associated with the photographs have evolved from speculation about the discoloration of the banana (as seen above) to assertions that human blood was purposefully injected into the banana in order to spread HIV:","Fact Check":"","Description":"As we noted in another article about a rumor concerning supposed blood-tainted oranges, it is nearly impossible for the HIV virus to be transmitted via foodstuffs: Except for rare cases in which children consumed food that was pre-chewed by an HIV-infected caregiver, HIV has not been spread through food. The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Dr. Bob Frascino came to a similar conclusion, although in a much sassier manner, when the question was posed on The Body forum in 2011: So you're worried that folks who test HIV positive \"lose moral control\" and inject blood into bananas? Dude, tell me you're kidding. Please tell me you're kidding. Because if you're not kidding, I'll have to assume you're a looney tunes fluffernutter. Yep, totally bat-sh*t crazy. Your blood-banana paranoia is too bizarre to even qualify for urban legend status. If above-displayed photographs do not show bananas that have been injected with blood (HIV-infected or otherwise), then what caused the discoloration they display? It's likely that these bananas are experiencing some form of fungal rot, such as a type referenced in a 2011 New Yorker article about a disease destroying millions of bananas via a fungus described as producing a visual appearance featuring a \"putrefying mixture of brown, black, and blood-red.\" Last updated: 11 November 2015","Originally Published":" 11 November 2015","Referred Links":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/10/we-have-no-bananas;http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/Q216765.html;http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html;","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, October 2015] I bought a bundle of bananas from the Walmart in Aberdeen tonight and opened it to give to my 2 yr old daughter.

 {"Origins":"People love to hear and pass along bits of secret information that supposedly enable them to gain advantage by manipulating \"the system\" to their favor whether the prize to be won is something as potentially significant as beating a breathalyzer test or keeping points off their driver's licenses, or as trivial as being able to zip through traffic a little faster than other motorists. That in many cases people are passing along rumors about schemes that don't work (and that they've never had occasion to try for themselves) doesn't seem to slow their proliferation.","Fact Check":"","Description":"A slightly different dynamic is at work in the claim that flashing your high beams at a traffic signal will cause it to change from red to green more quickly: Many motorists have tried it and discovered that it seemingly performs as advertised, thereby documenting the validity of the claim. What they don't realize, however, is that they've stumbled upon another example of the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy . This strategy works, drivers assume, because stop signals are equipped with sensors that respond to the flashing of strobe lights mounted on emergency vehicles. These traffic pre-emption systems automatically interrupt normal traffic light cycling to allow ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars to pass through intersections more quickly and safely by providing them with a steady stream of green lights while keeping opposing traffic halted with red lights. The adventurous motorist thus tries to trick these sensors by rapidly flashing his car's high beams as he approaches a red-lighted intersection, and voil the light turns from red to green. It works! Of course, in many cases the perceived results are nothing more than coincidence the light was already about to cycle from red to green, and the flashing high beams had no effect. Also, in many places advance sensors are placed in the road well ahead of controlled intersections. When these advance sensors detect the passage of an automobile, they place a \"call\" to the next traffic signal; if others sensors detect no vehicles waiting at the next cross street ahead, the signal changes from red to green to allow the oncoming car to flow through the intersection smoothly. Since advance sensors are generally placed at a point about the same distance away from intersections as the point where drivers start flashing their high beams to influence upcoming signals, it can easily appear to the unknowing that such flashing does indeed cause lights to change. A problem with a cause-and-effect belief in this scenario is that many intersections aren't equipped with strobe-detecting sensors, so motorists end up flashing their lights at traffic signals that don't care. And even when drivers happen upon strobe-enabled signals, the sensors are set to detect lights flashing at a rate so rapid (in the neighborhood of 14 flashes per second) that a human working a manual headlight switch couldn't possibly imitate it. Moreover, some traffic pre-emption systems are now activated not just by an on-off alternation of lights, but by a specific pattern of flashing. Naturally, a market has developed for transmitters that can effectively trigger traffic pre-emption systems, but the sale of such devices to non-authorized buyers has now been outlawed in most jurisdictions.

That image, entitled \"Dried up dam with submarine,\" was accompanied by a \"composition\" tag, indicating that it consisted of more than one photo: Last updated: 07 January 2016 Originally published:

 {"Origins":"In September 2015, a rumor started circulating via Twitter that the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 would be the 666th such event in history. If we assume that Halloween celebrations are held annually, this rumor suggests that the first Halloween took place in 1350. But Halloween does not have any definitive beginning (the holiday evolved over a long period of time and was influenced by several different cultures), and there is no basis for the notion that the first Halloween was held in 1350:","Fact Check":"Will the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 be the 666th in history?","Description":"It is widely believed that many Hallowe'en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church. Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning 'end of the summer'. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter. It is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process. A letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation. Encyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen \"in an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance\". The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe'en \"absorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain\". However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe'en, as the eve of All Saints' Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November. While Nicholas Rogers argued in his book Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night that \"festivals commemorating the saints as opposed to the original Christian martyrs appear to have been observed by 800,\" it is unclear when these festivals became what we know now as Halloween. According to various dictionaries, the word \"Halloween\" itself originated in the mid-18th century, a shortening of a term that dates to the mid-16th century: c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even \"Eve of All Saints, last night of October\" (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year's Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way. In the United States, Halloween was initially known as an occasion for playing pranks; the modern form of Halloween celebration didn't gain widespread popularity there until the early 20th century. Anoka, Minnesota, is often credited with holding the first official Halloween celebration in the United States, which took place in 1920: Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done. In 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized. It's impossible to pinpoint an exact year for the first Halloween, and the rumor about 2015's seeing the \"666th Halloween\" seems to be an offshoot of earlier joke memes claiming that in the current year Halloween will fall on Friday the 13th for the first time in 666 years.

 {"Origins":"Most of us probably don't stop to ponder why the maze of U.S. interstates and highways we travel in our automobiles are numbered the way they are just trying to find the correct road, get on it heading the right direction, and exit at the proper off-ramp is challenge enough. There actually is a rhyme and a reason to the numbering system used for U.S. highways, although the rhymes and reasons vary for different types of roads. Highways generally fall into one of three classes which generally use similar (but not identical) rules in assigning numbers: Interstate highways established under the aegis of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. U.S. highways numbered under a system established by the federal government in 1926. Regional roads numbered under individual state and county systems. INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS: Under the plan developed for a national interstate highway system during the Eisenhower administration, interstate highways (marked with the familiar red-and-blue shields) are numbered according to the following rules:","Fact Check":"","Description":"And, just to make things even more confusing, there are quirky exceptions to these rules: I-238 is not a spur off Interstate 38, because Interstate 38 doesn't exist. (The curious can read Grant Cooper's lengthy explanation of how this came to be.) Interstate 99 was assigned a high two-digit number (through legislation), even though it is not a major highway (it runs for only 58 miles between Wolfsburg and Bald Eagle in Pennsylvania) and is farther west than other interstates with lower numbers. U.S. HIGHWAYS: U.S. Highways (or Routes), marked with black-and-white badge-shaped signs, are assigned one- to three-digit numbers. Like interstate highways, they designate north-south roads with odd numbers and east-west roads with even numbers, but the numbering scheme is inverted: the numbers of north-south routes grow larger from east to west, and the numbers of east-west routes grow larger from north to south. NORTH-SOUTH EXAMPLES: US Highway 1 runs from Fort Kent, Maine, to Key West, Florida. US Highway 99 used to run from the Canadian border at Blaine, Washington, almost to the Mexican border at the city of Calexico, California. (Highway 99 has since been supplanted by Interstate 5 and is no longer designated as a U.S. Highway.) EAST-WEST EXAMPLES: US Highway 14 runs from Chicago, Illinois to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. US Highway 82 runs from Alamogordo, New Mexico, to Brunswick, Georgia. STATE AND COUNTY ROUTES: Individual states and counties use different types of signage to designate regional state and county roads. For the most part, states follow the Interstate and U.S. Highway patterns of assigning odd numbers to north-south routes and even numbers to east-west routes, but as always there are exceptions. California's Antelope Valley Freeway runs almost due north from the Los Angeles basin through the high desert, yet it's the 14 Freeway. In answer to that perennial trivia question, the state of Hawaii has three roads designated as interstate highways (all of them on the island of Oahu) because roads established under the purview of the Federal Aid Highway Act and receiving funding from the federal government are considered interstate highways, even if they fall completely within the borders of a single state. Hawaii's interstate highways are somewhat different than other interstates in that they are identified with numbers preceded by the letter H rather than the standard I, however.","Originally

 {"Origins":"As fuel prices go up, so does interest in various products and additives said to improve gas mileage. One of these is acetone, a widely-available solvent better known to most of us as nail polish remover. According to some, adding a few ounces of this chemical compound to a tank of gasoline will dramatically increase mileage, supposedly by assisting in the vaporization of fuel.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Although various claims have been made about acetone improving gas mileage by 25% or 30%, those avowals never seem to hold up to independent scrutiny: properly controlled experiments designed to measure the ballyhooed improvement fail to recognize any significant change. Curious motorists working in less controlled settings do at times seem to note an acetone-assisted improvement, yet their results are likely better chalked up to careless measurement or miscalculation, as their findings can't be reproduced in the lab. Confusing matters further is the issue that determining the effect of anything upon gasoline mileage is a bit more difficult to work out than it would seem, because so many different factors can affect the results. The same amount of fuel will produce different gas mileages on different days, depending upon variables such as the type of automobile, the weather conditions, whether the car's air conditioning was running, how fast the vehicle was driven, etc. Eliminating the effects of each of these factors from the computation is generally beyond the abilities of the average car owner with a passing interest in knowing how many miles to the gallon his pride and joy is getting. Were the decision of adding or not adding acetone to one's fuel tank merely a question of whether the practice boosted gasoline performance, that would be one thing, but unfortunately there are other issues to consider, such as the harm that the solvent can work on vehicles. Acetone is corrosive, which means it can eat away at rubber components such as gaskets and O-rings a particularly bad result for cars with rubber hoses in their fuel lines. Acetone will also eat the paint off a car. As Tom of Car Talk noted in January 2006: Here's our final reason not to use [acetone]: It dissolves paint. So if you slip and spill a little bit outside your fuel filler door, you'll have a nice, unpainted line running down to the bottom edge of your rear quarter panel. When we see you drive by, we'll know you didn't take our advice!

 {"Origins":"This legend's likely origin is the 1981 film Cannonball Run , wherein the Japanese entrant in a no-holds-barred cross-country road race makes use of lights-out driving, a quieted motor, and night vision goggles to evade police. One scene even has him blowing past a radar trap and the cops there deciding not to pursue him.","Fact Check":"","Description":"My earliest sighting of this tale being told as a true story comes from around that time from a fellow who says he heard it on the playground while in elementary school. Since then it's been told by any number of folks, almost without exception male. Plot snippets from movies can become urban legends, provided their basic premises are appealing enough and something in them resonates with current societal fears or wishes. The 'stealth car' qualifies on every level. In one sense, the story is about evil drug dealers who can afford fantastic cars thanks to their ill-gotten gains and are again putting the public at risk, this time by driving like invisible maniacs in the night. That the police eventually work out what's going on and slap the irons on these baddies confirms our need to believe law enforcement is equal to the task of taking on the drug trade and overcoming it. In this story, the monied conscienceless drug king proves no match for the honest cop who starts out befuddled and overmatched but ends up victorious. In another sense, the tale is the ultimate automotive 'wish fulfillment' legend which leaves folks drooling over the sugarplum of an impossibly fast car invisible to the gendarmes. Speed limits are all well and good, provided they're enforced on everyone else ; each of us secretly longs for the unfettered freedom to do whatever we like on the open road, including setting new land speed records, if that's what takes our fancy. At least in the realm of imagination, safety and concern for others ranks well behind the desire to have the baddest car in town, the jalopy the cops can never touch. Luckily (considering the state of human nature), the stealth car of legend is not also one of reality. Though fast cars exist, they can't be rendered invisible to all our senses and detection devices with a slap of black paint and the extinguishment of their lights. Even if the dream machine were made harder to see and its engine muffled, the noise it made as it passed would still be audible. More telling, the night vision goggles the driver donned would put him at risk of crashing and burning in very short order, especially if he were cruising the nation's highways at incredible speeds. Night vision goggles may seem to turn night into day (a day rendered in green, anyway), but they do so at the expense of depth perception. Though perfectly serviceable if the wearer is standing still or traveling at a controlled speed, NVGs produce a limited depth of field quite dangerous to someone trying to make sense of a rapidly changing landscape, where so much as one missed detail can prove fatal. Navigation is further complicated by rain, snow, and fog, all of which cut down the NVG's effectiveness. Light emitted from a car's instrument panel would also adversely impact the clarity of images picked up by the goggles. When used on public highways at any speed, NVGs represent accidents just waiting to happen. Oncoming headlights would cause the operator to be unable to see other objects in the field of view, and just one car coming from the opposite direction could render the NVG-wearer temporarily blind. While one might keep a car on the road during such an interlude at 30 m.p.h., at 200 m.p.h. the need for any sudden maneuver could send the car off the road and into a tree in the blink of an (unseeing) eye. (And if other cars on the road can't see you, you're in danger of their suddenly cutting you off or running into you from behind). The legend's basic premise that any random person can don a pair of night vision goggles, fire up the stealth car, and go rocketing around the country after dark fails the credibility test once the limitations of night vision technology are considered. A driver fresh out of the military and trained in this type of driving might be able to maintain control of a car traveling at 35 m.p.h. on a clear night, but even he is likely to be sent off the road into the ditch by the lights of oncoming traffic. As for someone untrained in the use of NVGs, he's not likely to make it out of the driveway without taking a hedge or two with him. Barbara \"there goes the hedge fund again\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"A friend of my father's was a cop in Nevada, and he was assigned the graveyard shift, posted outside of town on a little used section of road, given a radar gun and ordered to stay put and to pull motorists over for speeding. One night, while the officer waits by the side of the road, the radar gun starts screaming for no apparent reason at all, registering about 140. The officer, who was sleepy anyway, attributes this to a faulty gun, and ignores the incident. A week later the same thing happens again, on the same stretch of road, at about the same time at night. This time, however, the gun registers 145, and the officer pays more attention. Later, after his shift is over, he has the gun checked out for problems, and is told it is operating perfectly. A week later, same road, same time, the gun goes off. By now the police officer is confused, and angry. The next week he has men stationed at a road block a few miles down from the spot where he has been positioned. Like clockwork, the radar gun goes off, and he alerts his friends to get ready for whatever is racing down the highway. At the road block is stopped a black Lamborghini, with an engine iced and baffled for silent running. The driver is a drug mule, hauling a load and staying on the backroads, and less frequently monitored highways. The car itself is running without headlights, while the driver wears night vision goggles. Variations: Though the car is always black, its make varies from telling to telling. Lamborghinis are especially popular in this tale, but Maseratis, Ferraris, Jaguars, and Porsches turn up too. (Indeed, any expensive car that is presumed to be fast can be shoehorned into this legend.) This story has been told as a true and local occurrence in Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Kentucky, Nevada, New Jersey, and Florida. Sometimes additional details are given which specify the route: \"from New Orleans to Chicago,\" \"between Erie and Pittsburgh,\" and \"from his office in Henderson, KY to his home in Nashville.\" Usually the driver is described as a drug runner, but non-criminals (rich men who own fast cars) have also been placed behind the wheel. Typical to such stories, often both the speed the miscreant was going (\"200 m.p.h.,\" \"140 m.p.h.\") and the amount and type of drugs confiscated (\"20 lbs. of cocaine\") are specified. One (possibly Cannonball Run-influenced) version attributes the stealth car's presence on the highway to \"a cross-continental race on public roads, $$1000 per entrant, winner take all.\"","Last

Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve? Origin:Santa Claus and his reindeer won't be the only objects flying through the sky this Christmas -- an asteroid will be hurtling through the solar system, as well. According to several sensationalized headlines that were published in December 2015, Asteroid 2003 SD220 will come dangerously close to earth on Christmas Eve. \"Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve\" The newest asteroid being tracked due to its close proximity to earth is colossal. It s so huge that some claim its gravitational pull could cause earthquakes and make volcanoes erupt. Ironically, it s expected to just barely skim past Earth on Christmas eve. The 1.5 mile wide slab of rock known as 2003 SD220 is so large it could potentially wipe out a continent in the case of a direct hit. While it is true that Asteroid 2003 SD220 will pass by Earth on Christmas Eve, the above-quoted article gets several facts wrong. First, the asteroid will not be getting disconcertingly close to Earth. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the closest that the asteroid will get is about 6.8 million miles: \"There is no cause for concern over the upcoming flyby of asteroid 2003 SD220 this Christmas Eve,\" said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for NEO Studies at JPL. \"The closest this object will come to Santa and his eight tiny reindeer is about 28 times the distance between Earth and the moon.\" \"It's going miss Earth by a wide swath, and not be any hazard,\" JPL spokesperson Guy Webster told us. The asteroid also is not \"colossal.\" According to Space.com, the asteroid is relatively small at \"only about 1.24 miles\" wide. Asteroid 2003 SD220's flyby on Christmas Eve is basically a non-event for people outside of the astronomy field, as it is so small and distant that it will not even be visible to the naked eye. This is also not the first time that Asteroid 2003 SD220 has passed by Earth, and it will not be the last. According to NASA, it will make another flyby in 2018: \"The radar images data suggest that asteroid 2003 SD220 is highly elongated and at least 3,600 feet [1,100 meters] in length,\" said Lance Benner of JPL, who leads NASA's asteroid radar research program. \"The data acquired during this pass of the asteroid will help us plan for radar imaging during its upcoming closer approach in 2018.\" Three years from now, the asteroid will safely fly past Earth again, but even closer, at a distance of 1.8 million miles (2.8 million kilometers). The 2018 flyby will be the closest the asteroid will get to Earth until 2070, when it is expected to safely fly past our planet at a distance of about 1.7 million miles (2.7 million kilometers). JPL's Near Earth Object Office, which detects and tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and other space objects, is refuting and clarifying rumors on its verified Twitter account.

 {"Origins":"In November 2015, debate raged on social media networks regarding the escalating plight of Syrian refugees; during that time, a circulating rumor claimed Anne Frank was denied entry to the United States before her death in the Holocaust. While most Americans were familiar with Anne Frank (and many read her diary in school), the claim labeling her a prospective refugee seemed novel. Its appearance during an ongoing debate about Syrian refugees similarly prompted some skepticism among those who hadn't before heard the it, as Frank's ordeal and death comprised a story with which many were familiar.","Fact Check":"","Description":"On 14 February 2007 The New York Times published an article titled \"Letters reveal desperate plight of Anne Frank's family,\" reporting that documents newly uncovered by an accident of circumstance revealed the Frank family's failed attempts at entry to the U.S.: After lying undisturbed in a New Jersey warehouse for nearly 30 years, documents revealing the desperate efforts of Anne Frank's family to escape to the United States and Cuba from Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941 have been discovered thanks to a clerical error. \"I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to,\" Anne's father, Otto, wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., the head of the federal Housing Authority, a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's and the son of a Macy's co-owner, asking him to put up a $$5,000 bond. \"It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance,\" Otto Frank wrote. Page by page, the papers illustrate the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States in those days. Even with powerful connections and money, European Jews could not overcome the State Department's restrictions against refugees, said two Holocaust scholars who examined the documents. As the war in Europe intensified, so too did Otto Frank's efforts to transport his family to safety. He ultimately settled on an attempt to enter through Cuba, a plan which never reached fruition: By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children's rescue agency. Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. Reuters covered the discovery on 14 February 2007, including commentary from Holocaust scholars who lamented the family's failed attempt at passage: If her father had sought help sooner, \"Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today, a writer. That is what the YIVO's documents suggest,\" said Richard Breitman, a professor at American University. However, Otto Frank decided to try to escape just as the Nazis were making it more difficult to leave and the United States was making it more difficult to enter, Breitman said. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa on December 1, 1941, according to the documents, but it was canceled 10 days later when Germany declared war on the United States. A 2007 TIME article provided further details of Otto Frank's increasingly desperate efforts: For nine months, they tried to secure visas first to the U.S. and then to Cuba until that window shut. Just three letters of the file were written by Otto Frank, all addressed to university friend Nathan Straus Jr., son of a co-owner of Macy's department store and head of the U.S. Housing Authority. Straus and Frank's brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, regularly corresponded with two private Jewish agencies, the National Refugee Service in New York and the Boston Committee for Refugees. Straus also contacted the State Department on Frank's behalf. Hollander and his brother arranged affidavits from their employers, Jacob Hiatt of E.F. Dodge Paper Box Co. and Harry Levine of the New England Novelty Co., both of Leominster, Mass. An April 2015 article titled \"Op-Ed: Getting Anne Frank All Wrong\" published to Arutz Sheva addressed the plight of Anne Frank and other Jewish refugee children who perished: Otto Frank, Anne's father, dutifully filled out the small mountain of required application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from the family's relatives in Massachusetts. But that was not enough for those who zealously guarded America's gates against refugees. In fact, in 1941, the Roosevelt administration even added a new restriction: no refugee with close relatives in Europe could come to the U.S., on the grounds that the Nazis might hold their relatives hostage in order to force the refugee to undertake espionage for Hitler. That's right: Anne Frank, Nazi spy. Anne s mother, Edith, wrote to a friend in 1939: \"I believe that all Germany's Jews are looking around the world, but can find nowhere to go.\" On 4 September 2015, Anne Frank's step-sister Eva Schloss drew direct parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II: You must not be selfish and you must share whatever you have and help in a desperate situation. They need help from you. These people have had the courage to do a very difficult thing- to take your family and your whole life to another country requires bravery and strength. This is history repeating itself. These Syrians are valuable, educated people. These are doctors and nurses who are only too willing to help our society and they will become leaders in the community if you let them. The claim that Anne Frank \"was a refugee\" confused some readers, as they hadn't heard it prior to the Syrian refugee crisis. But the extent to which Otto Frank tried (and failed) to save his family from death during World War II was only first reported in 2007, and thus didn't appear in many history lessons before that. Ultimately Frank perished (likely of Typhus) at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, shortly after the deaths of her mother and sister Margot.

The photo of Amy Winehouse was taken in 2011 in London: Amy Winehouse heads to the Hawley Arms pub in Camden, north London, wearing a pink Pringle sweater.

The photograph of Lana Del Rey was taken in 2012 before a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert: This photo of Lana Del Rey was flipped in order to make the composite image of Rey and Winehouse.

Rebecca (@rebeccaseagull) June 21, 2015 Now only was this sign a digital forgery that was rehashed and regurgitated by a bevy of fake news sites in June 2015, it was also just a recycled version a similar hoax dating back to at least 2011. In the earlier version, the fabricated sign claimed that McDonald's was imposing a surcharge on black customers to offset robbery losses: One obvious hoax giveaway is that the toll-free contact number displayed on these signs (800-225-5532) is actually for KFC, not McDonald's.","Originally Published":"","Referred

 {"Origins":"We stop for red lights and go on green lights almost by instinct, so deeply steeped into us are our traffic rules. Just as we rarely give thought to the possibility of meeting a car traveling the wrong way on a one-way street, so too do we rarely pause to wonder where our traffic laws came from or who invented the crosswalk.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Meet William Phelps Eno (1858-1945), an innovator who long ago earned the sobriquet \"the Father of Traffic Safety.\" Born in New York City, this forward-thinking man observed the massive traffic jams of his era and from those observations formulated solutions that carried over from the days of horses and carriages into the automotive age. In 1900 he penned the treatise \"Reform in Our Street Traffic Urgently Needed,\" which immediately established him as a traffic safety expert, a mantle he was to wholeheartedlyembrace. In 1903 he developed the world's first city traffic code (for New York City) and the first traffic plans for New York City, London, and Paris. It was Eno who invented stop signs and who envisioned one-way streets, taxi stands, traffic circles, and pedestrian safety islands. He wrote the first manual of police traffic regulations, and it was he who designed the circular traffic pattern that courses around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In 1921 he established the Eno Transportation Foundation, a non-profit study center located in Washington, D.C. The Foundation is dedicated to improving all modes of transportation ground, air, and water. Eno was always a great fan of horseback riding but did not place all that much faith in the automobile, thinking it but a fad. He never learned to drive, and when events in his life necessitated car travel, he relied on a chauffeur. Eno's penchant for peculiarity outlived him. In 1996 his old home in Westport, Connecticut, came under the steady assault of determined bargain hunters who misunderstood the \"bargain\" they so intently pursued. Eno's 32-room mansion and the land it stood on had been sold for $$1.5 million, but the buyer wanted the choice waterfront land for the purpose of subdividing it, not for the 119-year-old building that stood upon it. The old manse was to be razed to make way for new housing. Rather than see old building torn down, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation stepped in and offered it for $$1 to anyone who would cart it away and give it a good home elsewhere. The costs of barging the mansion to a new site and restoring it were estimated at $$500,000 and $$1.7 million , respectively. The Today Show helped publicize the scheme, but unfortunately people heard only what they wanted to hear: that they could have a mansion for $$1. Everything about the land not coming with it and the building having to be carted away and set up elsewhere went in one ear and out the other. The property was overrun by folks determined to look it over, and they showed up at all hours of day and night, often necessitating calls to the police to have them removed. The previous owner (who was living in its carriage house) was driven to distraction by the never-ending stream of phone calls and letters pleading for the house. \"Keep Out\" signs had to be posted, and the road leading to the mansion had to be chained off to keep dollar-waving people out. Meanwhile, the Trust's office was also fielding hundreds of calls and letters, some coming from those who thought this was a lottery, and one from a gal who thought the mansion was a prize offered for an essay-writing contest. Even utter chaos eventually dies down. Hundreds upon hundreds of inquiries later, no one really wanted the house. It was ultimately demolished in July 1997.
